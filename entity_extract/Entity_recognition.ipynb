A typical first step in our strategic approach to improving your business is a comprehensive Business Process Review (BPR). Optimising simplifying your business processes can substantially improve your company’s performance. While revised processes alone can make a dramatic difference, but the biggest benefits of re-engineering are usually possible only with investment in technology. We can provide process review, redesign and innovation to ensure that there are clear and controlled processes that make effective use of organisational resources to deliver stakeholder value. By evaluating a company’s current practices and measuring its performance against globally competitive criteria, we are able to determine the most effective and efficient way for an organization to perform its functions, removing unnecessary steps and people in the process. A strategic business process review delivery framework is designed to identify opportunities for business process improvement, thorough the following four steps: Analyse Identify Quantify and Implement The information gathered from this evaluation helps us to: Define critical success factors (CSF’s) – areas in which an organization must perform well in order to be successful. Define existing or potential problems within a particular area. Define potential solutions which will help your organization reduce overall costs and provide more efficient use of resources. Program & Project Managements Our project and program managers are thought leaders and bring a wealth of knowledge and innovation to every engagement. Our objective is to maximise the benefit of an IT project or program initiative taken by your organisation. Both projects are constrained by time, budget and scope. It is the discipline of planning, organising, controlling as well as motivating resources to achieve specific goals. Our focus is to guide you in effectively implementing programs and projects which includes: Planning and Scheduling Estimation and Cost Management Resource Management Governance Risk Management Stakeholder Management\")\n",
