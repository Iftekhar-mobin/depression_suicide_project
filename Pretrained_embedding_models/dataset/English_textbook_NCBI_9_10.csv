0,"The aim of secondary education is to make the learners fit for entry into higher education by flourishing their latent talents and prospects with a view to building the nation with the spirit of the Language Movement and the Liberation War. To make the learners skilled and competent citizens of the country based on the economic, social, cultural and environmental settings is also an important issue of secondary education. The textbooks of secondary level have been written and compiled according to the revised curriculum 2012 in accordance with the aims and objectives of National Education Policy 2010. Contents and presentations of the textbooks have been selected according to the moral and humanistic values of Bengali tradition and culture and the spirit of Liberation War 1971 ensuring equal dignity for all irrespective of caste and creed of different religions and sex.
 Honorable Prime Minister of the Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina expressed her firm determination to make the country free from illiteracy and instructed the concerned authority to give free textbooks to every student of the country. National Curriculum and Textbook Board started to distribute textbooks free of cost since 2010 according to her instruction. In its continuation, this textbook has been reviewed and updated with a view to create a developed and resourceful Bangladesh keeping vision 2041 ahead.
 In the era of globalization, English is one of the most powerful tools for pursuing higher studies, using technology, inter-cultural and inter-personal communications, and job markets at home and abroad. The curriculum makes it explicit that language learning will be graded and contents will reflect real life situations as the ultimate purpose of language learning is to communicate. The English for Today textbooks have been developed to help students attain competency in all four language skills, i.e. listening, speaking, reading and writing. The contents and illustrations of this textbook have been developed in order to suit the learners' age and cognitive level.
 The textbook has been revised and re-edited by prominent educationists to make it learner friendly in 2017 and 2020. I thank sincerely all for their intellectual labour who were involved in the process of revision, writing, editing, art and design of the textbook. \n

 It was the night of 25th March 1971. There was a full of quietness at Bangabandhu's home at Dhanmondi Road No. 32 throughout the day Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his family members could apprehend that something tragic was going to happen. Gunshots were heard around the city. Bangabandhu's eldest son Sheikh Kamal was out of home for forming barricades against the Pakistan Army who had been killing people indiscriminately that night. Bangabandhu decided to send the girls of the family to a safer place for the night and he gave their responsibility to his son-in-law Mr. Wazed Miah. Bangabandhuâ€™s daughter Sheikh Hasina, who was expecting a baby soon along with her sister Sheikh Rehana and her cousin Farida were sent to a house at Road no. 15, Dhanmondi for that night. Bangabandhu's wife Begum Fazilatunnesa Mujib, stayed with him. 
 
 Just before midnight, Bangabandhu sent the declaration of Independence to Mt. Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury at Chattogram via wireless. At the darkest part of that night, the Pakistan Army surrounded his home and started firing at random. The situation agitated Bangabandhu much and he asked them to stop. But, soon he was instructed to get ready to go with them. Begum Mujib packed his necessary belongings. After Bangabandhu left, she was at a loss what to do and where to go with her children. However, being a supportive wife of the great leader all 
  
 through her life, she soon pulled up her mental strength. But, her anxiety continued till the end of the war.
 The next day Begum Mujib had to leave House No. 32 with her children and other members of her home. During the next couple of months, they moved from one shelter to another in search of a safer place. During their stay in those places, some people came forward to helping them while some refused to give them shelter for fear of their own safety. When their provision ran short, Sheikh Kamal, who had already joined the Liberation War, came to them in disguise and delivered some money. Some very close people also supported the family with money and food stuff.
 So far the family members were ignorant about Bangabandhu's condition. Suddenly they came to know that he was alive and had been taken to Pakistan. Begum Mujib started to keep contact with Awami League leaders. But soon the family was taken to Dhanmondi, House No. 18 by the Pakistan Army and kept under house arrest. However, people would come to their home with valuable information in disguise of vendors; also some would throw pieces of waste paper with important information written on them.
 In the month of May, the same year, Pakistan Army set fire to Bangabandhu 's Tungipara home in front of his parents. A young man from the village protested the evil deed and was shot dead. Both the parents of Bangabandhu fell ill in October and were admitted to the then PG Hospital. Begum Mujib and her family were allowed to visit them two or three times a week for one hour. However, that created the opportunity for them to establish a better communication with the freedom fighters.
 Begum Mujib was extremely worried about her children, especially her daughter Sheikh Hasina, because of her health condition. However, she was not allowed by the Pakistani rulers to be with her daughter, when she was admitted to hospital. Mr. Wazed Miah and Bangabandhu's second son Sheikh Jamal accompanied Sheikh Hasina to the hospital. Bangabandhu 's youngest sister, pretending to be a hospital attendant, entered the hospital and looked after her niece. Sheikh Hasina was blessed with a baby boy on 27 July who was later named Sajeeb Wazed Joy. As the Pakistan Army often used to threaten Sheikh Jamal that they would hang him upside down, he, finding an opportunity, fled from the hospital and joined the freedom fighters.
 Finally the Victory day arrived! There was joy everywhere! But, Bangabandhu's family was yet to be freed from captivity. The Pakistani occupational forces were still cordoning Bangabandhu's house and firing at people rushing over
  
 there chanting 'Joy Bangla ', the invigorating slogan of the Bangalees. But they fled the next morning when the Indian Army came to rescue the family. Sheikh Jamal returned home in the afternoon while Sheikh Kamal returned home the next day. Nevertheless, the biggest anxiety of the family persistedÂ­ Bangabandhu was yet to be released from Pakistani prison and they didn't know when that great moment would arrive and how.

 2.	Who do you identify in the picture?
 3.	Do you find any connection between the picture and the title of the lesson? How?
  
 B		Read the story of Bangabandhu's homecoming to answer the questions that follow.
 Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was arrested by the Pakistani army immediately after his declaration of independence at the first hour of the 26 March 1971. He was taken to Pakistan as a captive and imprisoned there in a small cell for capital punishment until 7th January, 1972. Even a grave was dug in front of his cell but Mujib was fearless. He knew nothing would stop the Bangalees to gain independence. In fact, his name and independence became synonymous. So the whole world was awaiting breathlessly to witness his homecoming. And he had a grand homecoming indeed narrated by eminent columnist and writer, Syed Badrul Ahsan. An abridged version of that narration is presented below.
 In the evening of 7 January, 1972; Bangabandhu left Chaklala Airport in Rawalpindi, from where he would fly to London. Nine months earlier he was brought to Pakistan as a prisoner with little hope to return. And now he was free to go home. Pakistan, as soon as the PIA aircraft took off, was finally behind him....
 Early in the morning on 8 January 1972, Bangabandhu arrived at Heathrow Airport. News of Bangabandhu's arrival in London spread quickly. Journalists, the general public, British officials and politicians and Bangalee residents in the city made their way to Hotel Claridges. News bulletins on the BBC and other media organizations made note of Bangabandhu's arrival in their headlines. By early afternoon, the Father of the Nation had met the British Prime Minister Edward Heath and the Leader of the opposition Harold Wilson. Then he called Dhaka and for the first time since his arrest by the Pakistan Army in March, spoke to his family. A long conversation then followed with Prime Minister Tajuddin Ahmad. The conversations with his family and with Tajuddin were emotional affairs, but he now had a clear picture of all that had happened in his absence in Bangladesh. It gave him immense pleasure knowing that he had truly liberated his people.
 Bangabandhu's opening words at a crowded news conference that evening at Claridges was a touch poetic. He expressed the unbounded joy of freedom ""'""l
 achieved by his people in an epic liberation struggle. Bangladesh, he told the 8l
  
 crowd, was a reality and would fulfill its obligations as part of the international community. He made it clear that those who were involved in different types of crimes including genocide would be trialled by his government.
 C.  Work in pairs. Write on the blank spaces how you would express these words/phrases in your own language and then make sentences with them.

 3.	How did London welcome Bangabandhu?
 4.	Do you agree with the statement that Bangabandhu was excited as well as relieved from long anxiety in London? Why/Why not?
 E		Read the following	texts by the same author that describes Bangabandhu's a few more hours of journey towards home.
 Bangabandhu left London for Dhaka on the 9 January evening in 1972. On the way he would stopover in Delhi. He was welcomed at Delhi's Palam Airport in the morning of 10 January by President V.V. Giri, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, West Bengal politician and Chief Minister Siddhartha Shankar Ray and the chiefs of the Indian armed forces. Bangabandhu stayed in Delhi for about two hours. During this time, he addressed a public rally and mesmerized everyone. There he wholeheartedly thanked Mrs. Gandhi, the people and the politicians of India for the tremendous help they had provided to Bangladesh and its ten million refugees.
  
 Then it was on to Dhaka, where millions of people had begun to crowd the route that their leader would pass and the Race Course Maidan where the leader would deliver a speech before going home. On the tarmac at Tejgaon Airport, soldiers of the Indian army and the Mukti Bahini were on standby to present Bangladesh's President with a guard of honour. Members of the wartime cabinet waited in the winter sun, as did a horde of newsmen. Sometime after 1:30 pm the Comet aircraft made available to Bangabandhu by the British government landed in Dhaka.
 As soon as the doors of the aircraft opened, Bangabandhu appeared. It was clear he had lost weight due to imprisonment for nearly ten months in a Pakistani prison. A big smile appeared on his face as he swept back his hair with his right hand. Prime Minister Tajuddin Ahmad then moved forward and buried his head in his leader's chest. Both men broke down. Their tears soon led to moist eyes in nearly everyone else present around them. Once the formalities at the airport were completed, the Father of the Nation climbed on a board of an open truck, with the Mujibnagar government figures and the student leaders crowding around him. He headed for the Race Course.
 The two-mile stretch of road would take the procession almost three hours to cover. At the Race Course, Bangabandhu wept remembering the sacrifices of the Bangalees had made in the war against Pakistan. He told how the military junta had tried to intimidate him during his trial. He said, ""I told them I am a Bangalee and a Muslim, who only dies once. I would walk the gallows with head held high."" The Father of the Nation remarked, the Bangalees had become the golden children of the Golden Bengal. Quoting the poet Rabindranath Tagore, who once had complained that the people of Bengal had remained mere Bangalees but were yet to become true human beings. Mujib told the jubilant crowd that the poet had been proved wrong. ""Come back, 0 poet"", he intoned dramatically, ""and see how your Bangalees are today transformed into worthy men.""
 Moments later, as dusk and a winter haze settled over Dhaka, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman made his way back to his family. They had been waiting for him at the house in Dhanmondi Road 32 where he had left his family before the Pakistan Army arrested him on the eve of the Liberation War.

 Dhaka was full of crowd. Inside a house, there were family members, relatives and many others. The wall clock was ticking at every second. Two daughters were getting impatient to see their father. They peeped through the windows a thousand times. Baby Russel was asking his mother, ""Ammo, when will Abba arrive?"". Then slowly stopped the convoy before the main entrance of the historic house at Dhanmondi 32..........

2,"Bangabandhu at the UN
      1	ED	TIO	S
 A	Work in pairs and discuss the following questions.
 1.	What do you know about the UN?
 2.	What do you know about Bangabandhu's speech at the UN?
 B	Read the text and answer the questions that follow.
 Bangabandhu's speech at the United Nation's General Assembly is a matter of great pride for us. He delivered the speech on 25th September 1974, just after a week Bangladesh became a member of the UN. To be a member of the UN was not an easy go as some influential countries were opposing the membership for Bangladesh. So it was another war that Bangabandhu had to wage.
  
 But finally, Bangabandhu won. He won not only the UN membership, but also everyone who listened to his ever first speech at the UN. It was a veni vidi vici experience for him - he came, he saw and he conquered everyone. Bangabandhu was the first person in the history of the UN to deliver a speech in Bangla, the language of the seventy-five million Bangalees, the language of the language martyrs. The poet of oration, the icon of charismatic leadership touched another milestone and so did the Bangalees through him. It was a speech that revealed Bangladesh's stand on national and international issues before the global community.
 Identifying the UN as the parliament for the humankind, Bangabandhu recognized the moment of delivering his speech historical. He mentioned that the very moment justified the century-long struggle and sacrifice of the Bangalees for self-rule, independence, dignity and co-existence along with other nations. He assured that Bangladesh would follow the ideology of mutual respect, national sovereignty, regional integrity, and non-interference into internal issues of other countries. Bangabandhu explained Bangladesh's absolute pledge to the UN charters and reminded how the people of his country made the highest sacrifice to achieve the same. The Father of the Nation added that Bangladesh would look forward to such a world where peace and justice would take their rightful place. It was essential to justify the sacrifice of the countless martyrs.
 In his speech, Bangabandhu expressed his utmost gratitude to the UN and the international community for standing beside Bangladesh with their aids and support in the reconstruction of the war-ravaged country, relocation of 10 million war-refugees who took shelter in India during the Liberation War. The leader of the country reminded the world how Bangladesh stood on the ruins and debris of a war where people were just struggling for survival. However, the repeated natural calamities were making their life harder and people even didn't have a minimum intake of food for a day.
 Going beyond Bangladesh, he expressed solidarity for all the oppressed people around the world and denounced racism, discrimination, imperialism, and the use of force to stop people's justified movements for their rights. Referring to the struggle of the people in Africa, Asia, Latin America, Namibia, Palestine and Zimbabwe, he expressed his worry about people's plight to achieve their own
 ""'""l  rights. The leader of the oppressed noted- when millions of people were destitute with unending miseries, only a handful of people were enjoying the
  
 highest luxuries. He emphasized quick measures for global financial management based on justice. Bangabandhu warned that an absence of such a system would lead the world to experience an unprecedented misery of the history.
 The leader of the third world countries expressed his deep concerns over a global recession and inflation, unemployment, unequal distribution of wealth and opportunities, and the gap between the rich and the poor countries. He described how those had hit the development plans in many poor countries of the planet. To Bangabandhu, it was a global responsibility to fight these problems and take concerted efforts to put an end to these.
 Before he concluded his speech, Bangabandhu declared that Bangladesh would follow the paths of togetherness, brotherhood, and mutual respect and cooperation. He expected the UN would take substantial roles in solving the prevailing human crises in the subcontinent as well as in other countries.
 Bangladesh has been following the paths of Bangabandhu, the dreamer and the peoples leader, even after his death nearly five decades ago.

 had a strong personality to ask for any clarification from any other leader of the world! Consequently, very soon, before Bangabandhu's next birthday, the withdrawal was completed.
 Bangabandhu had an open mind to maintain good relationship with all countries irrespective of their capitalist, democratic or socialist ideologies. He left no stones unturned to make entry into different global organisations. During the period between 1972 and 1975, Bangladesh signed more than seventy treaties, agreements, memoranda and contracts with different countries of the world. Managing entry into OIC (Organisation of Islamic Cooperation) and attending its conference at Lahore filled up a major gap in diplomacy of Bangladesh. It opened opportunities to explore all the possibilities of trade and other potentials with the Islamic world.
 Bangabandhu charmed common people all over the world. His speech in different summits revealed that Bangladesh did not only think about its own self, it was also concerned about injustices prevailing in the rest of the world. Bangabandhu sent a medical team to Egypt and Syria for the treatment of the war victims of Arab-Israel war. He always used to say, ""Today the world is divided into two parts - the oppressors and the oppressed. And I am with the oppressed."" This kind of strong voice and wisdom made his position firm as a global leader.
 He was such a leader for whom the British Prime Minister Edward Heath broke all the protocols to welcome him at Claridge's Hotel on 8 January, 1972 while Bangabandhu was returning from Pakistani prison. His elegance was reflected in the voice of a renowned journalist, ""The courage and charm that flowed from him made him a unique superman of these times.""
 Bangabandhu's philosophy of secular democracy honoured him with a firm position in the world. The period from 1972 to 1974 was actually a bright and busy era for Bangabandhu Government, when he visited many countries of Asia, Africa, Europe and Latin America. He made those visits to gain support from those countries and to promote friendly relationships with them. Consequently, wherever he went, he cast a very positive influence on the leaders of those countries. Among the world leaders who admired him were India's Prime Minister Mrs. Indira Gandhi, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Cuba's President Fidel Castro. His leadership, wisdom and personal relationship with world leaders made him a successful politician of international repute.

 Understanding yoga
 Yoga is a kind of posture and breathing exercise. It brings together physical and mental disciplines to achieve peace of body and mind, helping you relax and manage stress and anxiety. Traditional yoga puts emphasis on behavior, diet and meditation. But if you're just looking for better stress management- and not an entire lifestyle change-yoga can still help. Yoga trainers gradually choose easier to complex activities for practitioners. However, all practitioners do not necessarily need the same kinds of practice.
 
 The health benefits of yoga
 The potential health benefits of yoga are numerous and may include:
 â€¢	Stress reduction
 With its quiet, precise movements, yoga draws your focus away from your busy and chaotic day towards calm as you move your body through poses that require balance and concentration.
  
 
 â€¢	Increased fitness
 As you learn and refine new poses, you may enjoy improved balance, flexibility, range of motion and strength. And this means you're less likely to injure yourself in other physical endeavours or in your daily activities.
 â€¢	Management of chronic health conditions
 Yoga might help in a variety of health conditions, such as cancer, depression, pain, anxiety and insomnia, fatigue and mood shifts. Yoga can also help reduce heart rate and blood pressure.
 â€¢	Weight loss
 If you're overweight or have eating disorder, yoga may help you make the healthy lifestyle changes necessary to gain control of your eating and reduce weight.
 While you shouldn't expect yoga to cure you or offer you 100 percent relief, it can help some health conditions when combined with standard medical treatment. And if you already enjoy good health, yoga can be an enjoyable supplement to your regular fitness routine.

 Hi, I'm Shyam. I'm from Magura. Although it's the district headquarters, it's a small town. I'm in grade 9 now in Chander Haat Bidyaloya. I love games and sports very much. My father was an athlete in his student life. He inspires me to follow in his footsteps and take part in games and sports or do some exercise besides my studies. So I get up early in the morning and take a walk with my father almost every day. We walk for about an hour. At school, during break I play kabadi, gollachhut, badminton, table tennis, and carom. Sometimes I pracÂ­ tise the high jump and the long jump outside the school campus. Playing football is a passion for me. I like watching television too.
 
 I watch sports programmes on different TV channels during my free time. I'm a fan of National Geographic, Discovery, and Animal Planet for their documentaries as they are quite interesting as well as educative. Recently my father has presented me with a camera as he was very happy with the result of my Junior School Certificate exam. When I hold the camera, I feel so excited! I wish I could be an amateur photographer in future - not to take only personal photographs at different parties but to shoot our beautiful Bangladesh. I'm sure that soon photography will be my most favourite pastime.

 (Pl,,,m:K'.il1,yLeo,USA 'lUOAYSpmm]
  
 The Olympics have many memorable moments and athletes we'll remember by name alone. The list is quite big. Michael Phelps and Usain Bolt are the latest addition to this list of the bests. They made London Olympics stand apart. If there is any question like this: ""What is the standout performance of London 2012?"", perhaps the answer is ""The London Games gave us Michael Phelps vs. Usain Bolt."" The first one is an already decorated Olympian, who put the finishing touches on his great athletic careers. And another came up with a new definition of fast. Two of the most popular Olympic sports, sprinting and swimming, saw their two biggest stars captivating audiences. They'd also domiÂ­ nated the 2008 Beijing Games, but Phelps and Bolt cemented their legacies in London. Phelps, the American swimmer, passed gymnast Larissa Latynia for the most Olympic medals ever. Bolt was the third man to repeat as a 100-meter gold medalist and the first as a 200-meter gold medalist, and he broke his own OlymÂ­ pic record by running the 100 meter in 9.63 seconds. Once Phelps and Bolt were back in their pool and track, the story lines changed.
 Phelps is the most-decorated Olympian ever, with 22 overall medals: 18 gold, 2 silver, 2 bronze. Bolt is the most accomplished Olympic sprinter, with the unprecedented double, making clear that he's the fastest man in the world.
 But there's a debate: Who had the better Olympics? It'd be tough to top Phelps' eight gold medals in Beijing, but what if we're only talking London?
 London was Phelps' grand finale. He won four golds and two silvers in seven events, and he says he'll never race again.
 London was Bolt's chance to prove he's still the greatest. Bolt won six gold medals in six Olympic finals. He is the first man ever in the history of the modem Games to sweep the 100 and 200 in back-to-back Olympics. Not to mention the addition of back-to-back relay golds.
 And Bolt became a legend, in his own words. Phelps already was. Bolt is just 25 years old, so there is no telling how long he can be on top of the sprinting world. What if he decides to ""retire"" from sprinting to focus on the 400 meters, just to break another world record or two? It would be amazing and entirely possible for him to accomplish.
 
 Who had the better 2012 Games? You tell us, let the debate begin.

 Childhood outdoor pastimes 'in decline'
 Traditional childhood pastimes of climbing trees and playing conkers are in decline, according to a survey by the RSPB (Royal Society for the Protection of Birds). It's a charitable organisation registered in England and Wales.
 The survey shows that people under 34 recall far fewer such childhood outdoor experiences than people over 55,according to a survey by RSPB.
 People were asked which of the twelve childhood outdoor experiences they could remember. The answer included making dens, daisy chains, climbing trees,  playing conkers and feeding birds. Four out of five boys climbed trees and the same number of girls made daisy chains. But the survey showed the numbers declining among the newer generations.
 Some 15% more of those aged over 55 had these
 outdoor experiences in their childhood, compared with those between 15-34 years old. Some 92% of the public agreed that experiences of nature were still important to children, and 82% agreed that schools should play a role in providing them to all children.
 The survey has highlighted the positive impact of contact with nature on a child's education, health,
 wellbeing and social skills. At the same time, there has been a decline in these
 opportunities, with negative consequences for children, families and society-a condition now known as nature deficit disorder.
 Mike Clarke, chief executive of the RSPB, will meet parliament members to urge the government to join other organisations in providing children with firstÂ­ hand experiences of the natural environment....""We believe this guidance should include the many positive impacts to children of having contact with nature and learning outside the classroom.""

5,"Change in Pastimes in Bangladesh
 A	Tiya and Anusha decided to make a survey on students' pastimes in their class. After the survey they presented their findings in a chart. Look at the chart and read how they explain their findings.
 
 Items	For classes 9-10	For classes 5-6
 Playing games and sports	22.3%	9.2%
 Watching television	17.2%	31.2%
 Chatting with friends	13.7%	6.7%
 Reading books or magazmes	12.9%	11.7%
 Gardening	10.7%	6.1%
 Attending social programs such as music, recitations or debates	9.1%	7.8%
 Playing games on computers	8.2%	20.9%
 Others	5.9%	6.4%
 Tiya: Hello everyone! My name is Tiya. My friend, Anusha and I are going to do a presentation on Pastime Habits of Classes 9 and 10 students in our school. There are 120 students, 60 in class 9 and 60 in class 10. The classes have gender equity. Each class has 30 male and 30 female students. The survey shows that
 22.3 percent of students in classes 9-10 like games and sports as their most favourite pastime, which is the 4th option given by classes 5-6 students. Watching television is the second choice (17.2%) by the first group in contrast to 31.2% of the second group. It is noteworthy that watching television is the first choice of the second group. A considerable number (13.7%) of 9-10 students like to chat with their friends and thus it becomes the third popular choice in the chart while this becomes one of the less important choices by the younger kids. Only 6.7% of the kids take it as their first priority. It's interesting that both the groups like reading books. 12.9% of students of classes 9-10 take it as their favourite pastime. The number is 11. 7% for Classes 5-6 students. Besides, gardening is voted (10.7% of students) to be the 5th preference by the grown up
  
 group though it is not that much liked by the younger group. Only 6.1% of the young kids are involved in it. This is interesting that though the higher number of students in classes 9-10 prefer attending social programs ( 9.1% ) than students of classes 5-6 (7.8%), yet as a choice it is preferred by the latter group. It is the 5th choice for them while to the older group it is the 6thâ€¢ Young kids have greater fascination for playing games on the computers (20.9% like it as their first choice). The chart shows that as the kids grow up, they lose their passion for computer games. According to the chart the ratio declines to 8.2% from 20.9% when the kids are students of classes 9-10. Finally, it can be said that the influence of television has impact on both the groups but the more students grow up, the more they opt for fields/ gym.
 Questions
 1	What are the gender policy of the surveyors?
 2	What are the survey findings regarding watching television?
 3	Which age group is more interested in socializing with others?
 4	According to the chart, how do the kids change their pastimes when they are grown up? What changes does the chart for 9-10 reflect?
 B	Work in groups. Make a chart on the pastimes of the students in your class and present it to your class.

6,"Pastimes Vary
 A	Read the conversation. What is it about? Do you agree or disagree?
  
 Tiya
 
 Anusha Tiya Anusha
  
 Anusha, I really wonder how pastimes vary from generation to generation.
 Oh yes. I can tell you how.
 : Although I don't know exactly, I think time is a big factor.
 : You are right. Time changes many things. It changes our tastes and abilities. Technology has roles too. Look, there was a time when playing in the fields was very popular because we had many open fields around. Going to a neighbours' houses and hanging out in groups were popular pastimes as well. You won't see these activities now. The process of urbanization, the aggression of satellite television and people's dependence on technology have changed our lifestyle. Now boys and girls of urban and semi-urban areas are more dependent on the computer for social networking, video games, or computer assisted programmes.
  
 Tiya
 Anusha
  
 Right. But how do you know all these things, Anusha?
 : Oh....I read an interesting article on people's changing pastimes. It analyses the issue through a graph. Here it is. Read, and I'm sure you will enjoy it.

 There is change in people's preferences for pastimes. A recent survey shows that during the last twenty years, teenagers have gone through significant changes in choosing their pastimes. The survey results are presented through a graph which shows that there is a steady rise in young people's tendency to watch TY. In 1990, 41% of teenagers liked watching TV which increased to 48% in the next ten years and it further increased to 52% in the next decade. Unfortunately, the picture is grim in terms of young people's attraction to field games and sports. While 50% of youngsters opted for games and sports in the 1990s, the figure was 12% less after a decade at 38%. Unfortunately the falling tendency persisted through the next ten years and by 2010 it came down to 25%. Though the young people have dissociated themselves noticeably from games and sports, there is a sharp and steady rise in their association with online or computer assisted programmes. In 1990 when the users of online or computer for pastimes were only 9%, in 2000 the number nearly doubled and reached 14%, and with a rapid increase in the next ten years it shot up to 23%.

 The survey also explains the reasons for this change. It says that television has become a part of everyday life even to the underprivilegedsection of society. This has reBUlted in larger number of young people opting for watching TV as one of the most favourite pastimes. The increasing urbanization has ed	the number ofopen fields. Therefore, there isa fall in selecting games
 and sports as favourite pastim .though it'snot a good news for the oounuy.
 And the reason for selecting the computer assisted or online programmes is that computer technology is getting cheaper, easier and more popular everyday. Indeed,ouryoung generations arestepping intothee-world.

 May Day or International Workers' Day is observed on May 1 all over the world today to commemorate the historical struggle and sacrifices of the working people to establish an eight-hour workday. It is a public holiday in almost all the countries of the world.
 Since the Industrial Revolution(l) in the 18th and 19th centuries in Europe and the US, the workers in mills and factories had been working a long shift, fourteen or even more hours a day.
 On May 1st in 1886, inspired by the trade unions<2>, half of the workers at the McCormick Harvesting Machine Company in Chicago went on strike demanding an eight-hour workday. Two days later, a workers' rally was held near the McCormick Harvester Machine Company and about 6000 workers joined it The rally was addressed by the labour leaders.They urged the workers
 to stand together, to go on with their struggle and not to give in to their bosses. At one point of the rally, some strike breakers startedleaving the meeting place. The strikers went down the street to bring them back. Suddenly about 200 policemen attacked them with clubs and revolvers. One striker was killed instantly, five or six others were seriously wounded and many others were injured.

 21 February is a memorable day in our national history. We observe the day every year as International Mother Language Day. The day is a national holiday.
 On this day, we pay tribute to the martyrs who laid down their lives to establish Bangla as a state language in undivided Pakistan in 1952.The struggle to achieve our language rights is known as the Language Movement
 The seed of the Language Movement was sown on 21 March 1948 when Mohammad Ali Jinnah, the Governor General of Pakistan, declared in a public meeting in Dhaka that Urdu would be the only state language of Pakistan. The declaration raised a storm of protest all over the country. The protest continued non-stop, gathering momentum day by day. It turned into a movement and reached its climax in 1952. The government outlawed all sorts of public meetings and rallies to stop it.
 The students of Dhaka University defied the law and brought out a peaceful protest procession on 21 February 1952. When the procession reached near Dhaka Medical College, the police opened fire on the students, killing Salam, Rafiq, Bark.at, Safiur and Jabbar. As a result, there were mass protests all over the country and the government had to declare Bangla as a state language. This kindled the sparks of independence movement of Bangladesh.

 21 February is observed as Shaheed Dibosh every year throughout the country in remembrance of the martyrs of language movement of 1952. The commeÂ­ moration begins at the early hours of the day with mourning songs that recall the supreme sacrifices of our language martyrs. People wear black badges and go to the Shaheed Minar in barefoot processions, singing mourning songs. They place wreaths at the Minar. Many of them visit the graves of the martyrs at Azimpur graveyard and pray for them. They also attend various programmes organised in remembrance of the language martyrs.
 The UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation) on 17 November in 1999 proclaimed February 21 as the International Mother Language Day in recognition of the sacrifices of the martyrs for the rightful place of Bangla. Two Bangladeshi expatriates living in Vancouver in Canada, Rafiqul Islam and Abdus Salam, sent a proposal to Kofi Anan, the then secretary General of United Nations. They requested him to declare 21st February as the International Mother Language Day. They added that the decision will honour and save all extinct languages of the world. As per their logical expectations Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina then took prompt initiative by sending formal proposal to UNESCO. Finally, on 17 November 1999, UNESCO declared 21st February as the International Mother Language Day. The day is now annually observed worldwide to promote awareness of linguistic and cultural diversity and multilingualism.

 ""Okay, teacher. It happened when I was in class 6. On a weekly bazar day, people were coming back with their shopping bags and baskets in hands, on shoulders and heads. They had to cross the river. It was not a big river. There was a ferry boat plying on the river. The boat could cross it in 8-10 minutes. It was just after sunset. The weather was getting bad. The wind started blowing from the north-west. Black clouds were moving fast in the sky.
  
 
 Everybody was trying to get into the boat. 'No more, no more, please wait,' shouted the boatman. But nobody listened to him.""
 ""What happened then, Jamil?"" asked Rumi.
 ""With too many people on board, the boat sank in the middle of the river,"" replied Jamil.
 ""Oh no! What happened then?"" asked the teacher. ""Thank God. There were no casualties. All the passengers swam to the other side. But some of them lost the stuff they were carrying such as oil, salt and milk,"" said Jamil.
 ""Were you on the boat?"" asked the teacher. ""No, teacher. Seeing the boat overcrowded, I waited for the next boat,"" replied Jamil.
 ""You did the right thing, Jamil.""

 about.
 The class comes up with different problems. One group leader says, ""The scarcity of foodwill be a serious problem in the ycatS ahead. It is true that our agriculturists have developed new varieties of rice and its per acre production has definitely increased. Butthe rateof increasein foodproduction cannot keep pace with the:rateofpopulation growth. Thisis because our landisfixed, i.e.we cannot increase it, while our population is increasing tapidly.11
 Another group leader comes up with the houeingproblem in the country, which he says adds much to the food problem. He says, ""Families 811: growing larger in sizeand at the same time breaking into smaller families. Each smaller family needs a	house to live in. Also, the arable fields are being divided by these smaller families among themselves. Mills and factories are being set up, which occ:upy a cODSide.rable portion of our land. So while we need more land to grow morefoodto feed moremouths, our landis shrinking day by day.
  
 ""No way,"" another student argues. ""Trees are being cut, hills are being cleared and water bodies are being filled up --- all to meet the needs of too many people.""
 ""Thank you students,"" Ms Choudhury says, ""You're quite right. Let me tell you about this village where I was born and brought up. Things were not like this in the past. I remember as a child, the village was so beautiful! The green paddy fields and yellow mustard fields seemed to be unending. They used to wave and dance in the breeze. There used to be a wood in the northern side of the village. There was a tall tamarind tree in the middle of the wood. Also there was a big banyan tree which looked like a huge green umbrella, with its aerial roots hanging down. I often used to go there with my friends. We would often have picnic there. While the boys would climb the tamarind tree and pick some tamarinds, I and my best friend Rima used to swing from the hanging roots. But now, look, the wood is gone. The beauty of the crop fields is spoiled by the unplanned houses built here and there.""

12,"The Story of Lipi
 A		Discuss in groups and suggest how we can control the high growth rate of our population. Check whether your suggestions include any of the following:
 1	Raise awareness among the people, particularly in the rural areas, about the bad consequences of having more children in the family.
 2	Stop child marriage.
 3	Keep the size of the family small with two children.
 B	Read the story of Lipi and answer the questions.
 In the next class Ms Choudhury tells her students the story of Lipi.
 The year before last, Lipi, a 14-year old girl was in class 9 in a rural school in Rangpur. Lipi is the eldest of five children---three daughters and two sons. Their
 ""'""l	father is a day labourer working on other people's land and mother is a
 I""""!	homemaker and a part-time worker at other people's homes. The  parents,
  
 particularly the mother, found it really difficult to raise five children on the small income the father could earn. Perhaps that is why Lipi's father wanted to marry her off. But Lipi was not ready to accept what her parents wanted to impose on her. She wanted to pursue her education. Her mother stood by her, though secretÂ­ ly. When her father arranged her marriage with Tara Mia, the only son of a farmer in the same village, she became greatly upset. Tara Mia was a widower-ilÂ­ literate, but well off. His father had a few acres of arable land and was influential in the village. The marriage seemed to be inevitable.
 Question 1
 Discuss in groups and agree upon an answer to this question: What do you think Lipi should do? Why?
 Lipi first talked with her classmates and then with the Headteacher, who was very sympathetic to her. He called a meeting of the teachers and students of the school. He also invited the school managing committee members and some respectable persons of the village to attend the meeting. The Headteacher explained in detail the serious consequences that would follow Lipi's marriage. She would be having children from very early age -15 or 16. It would create constant health hazards to her. Her education would stop. On top of all, her marriage against her will might shatter her future dream. At one stage, Tara Mia's father stood up and tried to argue, ""You are all making mistakes. Lipi would be very happy if she got married with Tara Mia. She would have everything- money, clothes, home and status in the society. Why are you trying to deprive her of this opportunity?""
 But no, the big majority, who attended the meeting, supported the Headteacher. Lipi's marriage was called off. She is now studying at Carmichael College, Rangpur.
 Question 2
 Make predictions. One is done for you.
 If Lipi had married Tara Mia that time, ...
 a   she would have become a mother of one or two children. b

13,"Let's become skilled workforce
 A	In groups discuss the following question and give your opinion to the whole class:
 Why should we learn English?
 B	Read the conversation between Ratan and Rumi to find out about the importance of English.
 Rumi: You remember my brother Raihan, don't you? He applied for a	front
 ""'""I		desk officers' job in a 5-star hotel. Ratan: What happened? Has he got the job?
  
 Rumi: No! He couldn't answer most of the questions in the interview. Ratan: Why? He did well in the HSC, didn't he?
 Rumi: Yes, he did. But the recruiting officer in the interview asked him questions in English and he couldn't understand most of them.
 Ratan: Sorry, but I have a different story to tell you. My cousin Sheela did her HSC from a college in Mymensingh. She couldn't do as well as Raihan in her exams, but she got a job as a crew member in Biman Bangladesh. She said she had answered all the questions in English both in her written test and interview.
 Rumi: Great! She must be good in English. Well, then the key to getting some jobs is English, isn't it?
 Ratan: Yes, you're right.
 
 ,C	Discuss in groups.
 1	Try to find out why English is needed for a good hotel front desk job and a flight crew member.
 2		Choose two I three other jobs where English is needed and write why and how English is used in those jobs.
 D	Read what Ms Choudhury says to her students about learning English.
 
 ""Today there are many jobs where you need English. This is because the world has become smaller. Vast distances are shortened by speedy transports. We can talk to a person thousands of kilometers away on the phone or the Internet. So we can communicate with the whole world easily. English has made this communication easier.
 There are many countries in the world with many languages, but to communicate with them, you cannot use all the languages. So you need a common language that you can use with more or less all the people in the world. English is that common language. You can talk to a Chinese toy maker, a French artist, an Arab ambassador or a Korean builder in one language- English.
 English, for us in Bangladesh, is all the more important. As we have seen earlier, we are too many people in a small country. So if you learn English, you have the best opportunity to find a good job, both within and outside the country. And that is good news for millions of our unemployed youths.""
  
 ""But Miss, we learn English for 12 or 14 years, yet we do not find good jobs,"" says Rumi. She then tells the class about what happened to her brother. ""Could you please tell us why?"" Rumi asks.
 ""This is a very important question, Rumi. We should learn how to use English both orally and in writing for doing things as needed in our work, such as communicating with others at personal, social, national and international levels. But unfortunately, at the moment we are learning English mainly for our exams,"" continues Ms Choudhury. ""Remember, English can greatly help you become skilled workers.""
 ""But where and how can we learn such kind of English, Miss?"" asks Ratan. Ms Choudhury says, ""We can learn English both in and outside the classroom. Besides your textbooks, the radio, television, newspapers, magazines, computers and other supplementary materials will greatly help you. During our classroom activities, we'll see how we can learn English.""
 
 E	Write a paragraph by rearranging the following sentences or sentence parts.
 1	You can learn a common language in and outside the classroom.
 2	You cannot speak all the languages of different people of different countries to communicate with them.
 3	For example, you can do businesses with a Chinese, a Japanese, a French, an Arab or a Nigerian if you know English.
 4	Also other things like the radio, TV, computers and newspapers can help you learn English.
 5	Therefore you need a common language, i.e. English, which is understood by people more or less all over the world.
 F	Discuss in groups and write answers to these questions.
 1	Describe briefly the things that have made the present world smaller.
 2	Give reasons why a common language is needed in today's world.
 3	Why is English needed all the more in Bangladesh?
 4	How can our youths become a skilled workforce?

14,"The Greed of the Mighty Rivers
 A	Read the following text and answer the questions.
 Meherjan lives in a slum on the Sirajgonj Town Protection Embankment. The whispering wind from the river Jamuna makes the fire unsteady. The dancing flames remind Meherjan of the turmoil in her life.
 Not long ago Meherjan had everything- a family, arable land and cattle. The erosion of the Jamuna gradually consumed all her land property. It finally claimed   her   only
 shelter during the last monsoon. It took the river only a day to devour Meher's house, trees, vegetable garden and the bamboo bush. She had a happy family once. Over the years, she lost her husband and her family to diseases that cruel hunger and poverty brought to the family. Now, she is the only one left to live on with the loss and the pain. The greedy Jamuna has shattered her dreams and happiness.
 There are thousand others waiting to share the same fate like Meherjan. Bangladesh is a land of rivers, some of whose banks overflow or erode during monsoon. Erosion is a harsh reality for the people living along the river banks. During each monsoon many more villages are threatened by the mighty rivers like the Jamuna, the Padma and the Meghna. It is estimated that river erosion makes at least 100,000 people homeless every year in Bangladesh. In fact, river erosion is one of the main dangers caused by climate change. If we can't take prompt actions to adapt to climate change, there will be thousands of more Meherjans in our towns and villages every year.

15,"Environmental Pollution
 A	Look at the pictures below and discuss the questions.
 1	What do you see in each picture?
 2	What are some of the common sources of environmental pollution?
 3	Which of these sources are most threatening for your environment?
  
 
  	 
 Picture 1	Picture 2
 
 Picture 3	Picture 4
 B	Now read the following passage to know more about environmental pollution in Bangladesh.
 Bangladesh is now in the grip of all sorts of pollution like air pollution, soil pollution and water pollution. The dwellers of the urban areas are the worst sufferers of such pollution. The indiscriminate industrialisation process in Bangladesh over the past decades bas created significant environmental problems. We will now read about some of the most common types of environmental pollutions and ways of coping with them.
 Air Pollution
 Air pollution comes from a wide variety of sources. In Bangladesh poisonous exhausts from industrial plants, brick kilns, old or poorly-serviced vehicles and dust from roads and construction sites are some of the major sources of air """" pollution.
  
 
 We can minimise this type of pollution by making less use of motor vehicles and avoiding the use of vehicles older than 20 years. We may also use proper lubricants to lessen the level of emission and pollutants. We can encourage people to use Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) or Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) for fuelling their cars. The government may relocate hazardous industries like brick kilns to areas away from human habitations.
 Water Pollution
 Water pollution can occur in oceans, rivers, lakes, ponds and underground reservoirs. As different water sources flow together, the pollution can spread easily and quickly. Causes of water pollution include:
 â€¢	increased sediment from soil
 â€¢	eros10n
 â€¢	improper waste disposal and littering
 â€¢	leakage of soil pollution into water supplies
 â€¢	organic materials that decay in water supplies
 In fact, polluting the land means polluting the water. Throwing away a toxic substance on the ground near a water source means it eventually reaches the body of water. As a result, the water is polluted. Industrial wastes must not be disposed in rivers or lakes. We need to be more careful about disposing household wastes too. Use of pesticides means that when it rains, chemicals used in the lawn or garden wash into the water bodies. Therefore, we must be aware of the dangers of using pesticides as they may pollute our rivers, canals and lakes.
 Soil Pollution
 Among the most significant causes of soil pollution is the enormous volume of industrial waste which is being produced every day but not disposed properly. The mismanagement of household wastes, particularly the polythene shopping bags, has caused serious threat to the soil and the drainage system. Another cause for soil pollution is the use of agricultural pesticides, fertilizers, etc. Sometimes fuel leakages from automobiles may get washed away by rain and seep into the nearby soil.
 Pesticides and fertilizers are useful for plant growth but their overuse has led to """"'I  soil pollution. Natural fertilizers and compost can be used instead of their chemical	alternatives. Recycling is another way to reduce and control soil
  
 
 pollution. Recycling papers, plastics and other materials reduces the volume of refuse in landfills. De-forestation also causes erosion, pollution and the loss of fertility in the topsoil. Planting trees and re-forestation help prevent soil erosion and pollution.

16,"Man and Climate
 A	Discuss the questions in pairs.
 1	Can man influence the climate? If the answer is yes, explain how?
 2	Which human activities are responsible for increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere?
 3	How can trees help save our environment?
 Now read the text below and find answers to the above questions.
 Humans can neither change the sun's radiation nor the earth's orbit around the sun. But they can control the increase in the amount of greenhouse gases and its effect on the atmosphere. Only during the last hundred years the carbon dioxide concentration has been raised alarmingly in the atmosphere and we humans can be held responsible for this.
 The main cause of the increase in carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere is the burning of fossil fuels. Since the end of the 19th century, industrial activities increased rapidly giving rise tomany factories. These factories required energyt which was produced through the combustion of coal. Besides coal, other sources of energy such as mineral oil and natural gas were also burned to heat our houses, run cars and airplanes or to produce electricity. Nowadays, about 85 million barrels of crude oil are burned daily. Every time a fossil raw material is burned, it releases carbon dioxide into the air.
 Forma-9, English For Today-9-10
  
 
 Therefore, it is clear that more and more greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide are being generated worldwide by humans. Moreover, we are also strengthening the greenhouse effect by deforestation, which means cutting down trees. Every year enormous areas of forests are destroyed by people to obtain wood and to clear regions for mining and to create pasture. This loss of the forest causes dual problems. Trees that are burned up release large volumes of carbon dioxide gas into the air. On the other hand, as forests absorb a lot of carbon dioxide from the air and deliver oxygen instead, we also destroy an important storehouse of carbon dioxide when we clear forests.
 B	Read the statements below and say if they are True/False. If false, give the correct information.
 1	Fossil fuels are burned at an alarming rate due to industrialisation.
 2	Coal is the only fuel used for generating energy.
 3	At present, nearly 85 million barrels of crude oil are used weekly.

17,"Putting Our Fish in Hot Water!
 A		Spend one minute thinking about your life as a fish. In pairs, talk to another ""fish"" about your life as a fish.
 B		Do you agree with the following statements on fish and fishing? Discuss with your partner(s).
 a		Fish will never disappear. There will always be enough fish to feed the world.
 b	In many ways, people are like fish.
 c		The hobby of fishing should be banned to help protect fish population.
 C	Read the text below and say if the statements that follow are True/
 False. If false, give the correct information.
 Fish population is in serious danger from global warming. Climate change is increasing the water temperature in rivers, lakes and seas. This means there is less food and oxygen available for fish. It also means the fish may not grow fully and may have fewer fish fries. Some fishes will become extinct if temperatures rise even by one or two degrees Celsius.
 Climate change increases the pressure on fish population. Fishes are one of the world's most valuable biological assets. Forty percent of people in the world eat fish as their main source of protein. If we fail to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we will increase the pressure on fish. As a result, people who depend on fish will suffer from hunger and poverty.
 Statements:
 1	Global warming will kill all the fishes within ten years.
 2	Some fishes can not reproduce if the water is too warm.
 3	A two degree Celsius rise in temperature will make some species extinct.
 4	Fishes are valuable economic investments.
  
 5	Nearly 14% of people depend on fish for their basic food needs.
 6	People will suffer a lot if greater pressure is put on fish.

18,"A Friend of the Earth
 A	Discuss the questions in pairs.
 1	Do you throw away empty cans and bottles?
 2	What do you do with your old newspapers?
 3	What happens to the garbage after you throw it
 away?
  
 B	Read the following text carefully to know about how we can save our environment.
 LET'S SAVE OUR PLANET!
 Everyone must play a part in protecting the environment. There are many things you can do on your own every day to help save the planet. Here are some suggestions.
 REDUCE!
 Really, the best thing we can do for the planet is to use its resources properly. Our unplanned activities are mainly responsible for the environmental crisis. Here are some questions you can ask yourself before buying something, ""Do I really need this?"" or ""Is there another product which would do the same thing but is more sustainable?"" Or ask the question, ""Will this last a long time?"" Some other questions may be, ""Do I know how this item was made, how it will be used and how it will be disposed of?""
 REUSE!
 What do you think of using your own ceramic cup or mug at your school or local club? It means there are no plastic cups to throw away. You can wash it and reuse it every day. Unfortunately, we are encouraged to buy a new ""improved"" item even if the one we have can be repaired or reused. When we buy things, we should buy those that are durable; we should use them properly, and have them repaired when necessary. If we practise this, many things will not only last a life-time, but also be passed on for future use. However, if something is truly unusable for its original purposes, try to be more creative and think of how else it might be used. When you're done with it, think of whether someone else might be able to use it. You can donate some of the things to the poor. You may also sell some of your used items through personal advertisements in a local newspaper or in social media.
 RECYCLE!
 Rather than throwing an item out when neither you nor anyone else can make use of it, have it recycled. And if recycling is not possible, it is better to send goods to a landfill or have them burned up. Find out what types of materials can be recycled in your area. Clean and sort the materials before putting them out in the bin. Recycling your drink and food cans means there will be less trash in a resource recovery facility or landfill. Moreover, a company can use the old cans
 to make new ones.	l'-l
  
 C	Now ask and answer these questions in pairs.
 1	How can you cut down your shopping list?
 2	What can you do to reuse things?
 3	What kind of household goods, clothes and toys, can be donated?
 4	How can you sell your used items?
 5	How recycling may help save our environment?

 E	To do this exercise, you will need information about recycling in your local community. If you don't know, ask your teacher to help you learn what you can recycle from your home. Then choose one item from the box to talk about it following the model below.
 A: What are you going to do with these old magazines? B: I don't know what to do with these.
 A: Why don't you reuse/recycle them? B: How can I do that?
 A: It's easy. Take them to a shop that buys old newspapers and magazines for recycling.

19,"Nepal, The Land of Everest
 A	Read the following passage on Nepal.
 a	Known as the Land of Everest, Nepal is one of the most charming coun1ries in Asia. The Kingdom of Nepal is a small land of sublime beauty. It has some of the world's best and very important temples. It is a country that is rich in scenic beauty and cultural heritage.
 
 b	Nepal lies between India and the Tibetan part of China. This small country has an area of 147,181 square kilometers. Southern Nepal is tropical low land known as the Terai Plains. This part of Nepal has hot summers and warm winters. Here the temperatures reach up to 40Â°C in April and May and monsoon rains drench this region from June to September. The central
 hill-lands including the Kathmandu and Pokhara valleys have a temperate climate and are also influenced by the monsoon. North of that is the slope of the main section of the Himalayan range. This part of Nepal has some of the highest peaks of the world including Everest.
  
 c		Nepal is home to nearly 29,000,000 people. The population is primarily rural.Kathmandu, the capital city, has less than one million inhabitants. Nepal's demographic features are complicated not only by dozens of ethnic groups, but by different castes. In total, there are 103 castes and ethnic groups living in this small country. The two largest of such groups are known as Chetri and Bahun. Others include Magar, Tharu and Tamang, Newar, Muslim, Gurung and Damai. About 48 percent of the people speak Nepali. Among other languages spoken are Maithali, Bhojpuri, Tharu and Tamang.
 d	Nepal is the holy land of Lord Pashupatinath and Gautam Buddha where the Hindus and Buddhists have lived together in harmony for centuries. The Temple of Pashupatinath is the most sacred Hindu shrine and one of the four most important sites in the world for Shiva worshippers. Lord Buddha, the light of Asia, was born in Lumbini in Nepal's southern plains, which makes this a sacred pilgrimage destination for the Buddhists as well. In fact, many Nepalese combine Hindu and Buddhist practices; many temples and shrines are shared between the two faiths, and some deities are worshipped by both Hindus and Buddhists.
 e	The Kathmandu Valley is the richest cultural heritage centre of Nepal.

 2	What is the country surrounded by?
 
 3	What do you know about the country?
 
 B	Now read the following passage to find your answers to the questions in A.
 a Anyone visiting Sri Lanka may often hear the word Ayubowan. This word means 'May you have the gift of long life'. It is with this traditional greeting that everyone is welcomed to Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka is variously known as: Serendip, Ceylon, Teardrop of India, Pearl of the Indian Ocean, etc. These names reveal the richness and beauty of this island nation. Many travellers, from ancient mariners and merchants to present day tourists, have been attracted by the beauty of this island.
  
 b	Sri Lanka is located in the Indian Oc			just			off		the	south-eastern coast		of			India.		 Shaped	like a teardrop,		the		island of Sri Lanka measures			about			415			kilometers from	north			 to	south,		and		about
 220	kilometers		from east to west, with		a total		land area of		about 65,600		square		kilometers.	It		has more			than	1340	kilometers		of coastline.
 c		Despite its modest size Sri Lanka has a population of about 20 million. Sri Lanka is a multi- religious, multi-racial and multi- lingual countty. The four major ethnic groups are the Sinhalese, Sri Lankan Tamils, Indian Tamils and Sri Lankan Moors or Muslims. A fifth group, the Veddhas are the original inhabitants of the island. The ancient history of Sri Lanka is depicted in the Hindu epic the Ramayana and in the
 Mahavamsa or 'The Great Chronicle'.	Colombo: The capital city
 d		Sri Lanka's economy has traditionally been based on agriculture. The emphasis is on exporting crops such as tea, rubber, and coconuts. In fact, Sri Lanka is the largest tea exporter of the world. The country is also a major producer and supplier of a variety of spices such as cinnamon, cardamom, pepper, cloves, and nutmeg. Cinnamon first originated in Sri Lanka and was introduced later to the world by the Arab merchants.
 e		Sri Lanka's archaeological treasures may be compared to other civilizations of the past like the Golden Age of Greece, the Roman Empire and Mayan
  
 citadels. The culture has been influenced by the western colonisers and eastern traders. That resulted in developing a unique mix of races and religions, arts and crafts, festivals and costumes in this small country.
 Besides the man-made riches, one may find the God-given blessings of nature in Sri Lanka. The island is circled by azure seas and is blessed with sandy beaches, green hills, cascading waterfalls, abundant wildlife and a variety of flowers and fruits. The country abounds with coconut groves, spice gardens, tea estates and many other gardens and woods. Travellers from all over the world come to Sri Lanka. Here, a weary traveller can pass a relaxing day by a palm-shaded lagoon looking at the endless ocean. And for the adventurous, days can be full of excitement snorkelling, swimming, fishing or sailing.

 B	Now read the text below and answer the questions in C, D and E.
 The Republic of Maldives is an island country in the Indian Ocean. It has 1199 islands that are clustered into 26 major atolls. An atoll is a ring-shaped coral reef or a string of closely spaced coral islands. The natural coral reefs of the Maldives are surrounded by the sea all around and stand out as a pearl in the Indian Ocean. The Maldives is the eighth smallest country in the world with an area of only 300 square kilometers . It is the smallest Asian country in terms of population and size.
 
 People have been living on the islands of the Maldives for nearly 3000 years. They set sail from different parts of the world - Asia, Arabia, Europe and America - to come to these islands. The earliest settlers of the Maldives were probably from southern India and Sri Lanka who came to these islands in the fourth and fifth centuries BC. In the 12th century AD, sailors from East Africa and Arab countries came to the Maldives. AB a result, the Maldivians who were originally Buddhists were converted to Sunni Islam in the mid-12th century. In 1344 lbn Batuta, a famous Arab historian and scholar travelled around the Maldives.
 In the 16th century, the Portuguese conquered the Maldives and ruled the country for 15 years. Although governed as an independent Islamic sultanate for most of its history from 1153 to 1968, the Maldives was a British colony from 1887 to 1965. Following independence from Britain in 1965, the sultanate continued to operate for another 3 years. On November 11, 1968, the sultanate was abolished and replaced by a republic and the country assumed its present name.
 The Maldives is famous as a tourist destination because of its pleasant weather, heavenly beaches and lagoons, luxurious holiday resorts and the peace-loving ,.,., people. The Maldives was ranked as the best country for beautiful beaches and
  
 
 facilities for recreation in 2008.
 The Maldives is well known for being the lowest country in the world. Unfortunately, this small country with idyllic natural beauty is under threat from rising sea levels due to global wanning. Most of the country is just 1.5 meters above sea level with the highest point of2.3 meters! Many predictions have been made with respect to Maldives being swept away by the rising water level in the Indian Ocean. when the power tsunami of 2004 hit the island nation, many of the island's dry parts were flooded by the sea water. The government of the Maldives has begun to purchase land from nearby countries for resettling
 its people in case the islands go under water! In order to highlight the threats of global warming to its low lying
 islands, the government of Maldives held a cabinet  meeting  undeiwater  in  2009.
 That was the first ever underwater cabinet meeting in the world. The meeting took place about 5 meters underwater, in a blue-

 populous country after China. Its population is around 1.5 billion. New Delhi is the capital of India and about 13 million people live in the city.
 India is a land of ancient civilization. The social, economic and cultural diversity of this vast country is the result of invasions by different races in the process of history. Indian history begins with the birth of the Indus Valley Civilization and the coming of the Aryans. During this period, Aryan culture flourished in this part of the world. The fifth century saw the unification of India under Ashoka, and it is in his time that Buddhism spread in many parts of Asia. In the eighth century, Islam came to India for the first time and by the eleventh century it had firmly established itself. In 1206, Qutbuddin Aybeck founded the Delhi Sultanate. This was finally succeeded by the Mughal Empire in 1526, under which India once again achieved a large measure of political unity.
 It was in the 17th century that the Europeans came to India. This coincided with the disintegration of the Mughal Empire, paving the way for supremacy of the English, the French, the Dutch and the Portuguese who were vying with each other to gain control of India. The English emerged as the 'victors'. In 1774, Warren Hastings was appointed the first Governor General of India by the East India Company. In 1876, Queen Victoria was given the title 'Empress of India' by

 Bhutan is the first country in the world with specific constitutional obligations on its people to protect the environment. According to the constitution, at least 60 percent of the country must remain under forest cover at all times. Efforts are also taken to protect the nation against the intrusion of foreign cultures and values. The first foreign tourists were allowed into Bhutan in 1974. Now, tourism is encouraged but is controlled and limited to about 6,000 visitors a year. Bhutan is one of the last countries in the world to introduce television and the Internet to its people. The government lifted a ban on TV and the Internet only in 1999. The Bhutanese government has made it mandatory for all Bhutanese to wear only their national dress in public.
 Finally, the most interesting fact about Bhutan is that they are the only country that measures success in Gross National Happiness rather than Gross National Product! In 2006, Business Week rated Bhutan as the happiest country in Asia and the eighth happiest country in the world.

24,"Zainul Abedin, The Great Artist
 
 Zainul Abedin in 1955
 A.	Work in pairs and discuss the following questions.
 1.	Do you know this person? Why is he famous?
 2.	Can you name some of his world famous sketches?
 B.	Now read the text below and answer the following questions:
 ZainulAbedin (29 December, 1914 - 28 May, 1976) was a Bangladeshi painter. He had an extraordinary talent and was internationally recognized for his paintings. He became well known in 1944 through his series of paintings on the great man-made famine in Bengal during British Colonial rule.
 He played a vital role in the art movement in Bangladesh and was the founding Principal of the Government Institute of Arts (Now Faculty of Fine Arts) at University of Dhaka. His paintings on Bengal Famine are considered as his most characteristic works. His homeland honoured him with the title 'Shilpacharya', or the great teacher of arts for his artistic and visionary qualities. He was a pioneer of the modem art movement and was rightly considered as the founding father of Bangladeshi modem arts.
 Abedin was born in Kishoregonj on 29 December, 1914. He spent most of his childhood near the scenic banks of the Brahmaputra River. The river and the open nature inspired him from his early life. The Brahmaputra later appeared in many of his paintings and remained a great source of inspiration throughout his r-ri career. As his tribute to the river Brahmaputra, he drew a series of water colour	f""-1
  
 paintings in 1hill regard. Thia helped him eam Governor's Gold Medal in all India Bxln""bition in 1938.This was die first time when he came under spotlight and this award gave Abedin the confidence to create his own visual style.
 Abedin got admitted to the Government School of Art in Calcuna (Now Government College of Art and Craft, KolbJa, India). Here he learned European academic style for five years.Later he joined1he faculty of the same school after his gt'8d11ation. He was the first Muslim student to obtain 'First Ciusâ€¢ withdietinction fromthe school.In 1951, Zainul wentto London to study at Slade School of Art for two years. From the dissatisfaction of oriental style and the limitations of European academic style, he was attracted to realism. After hisreturnfromLondon, hestmted a new stylecalled 'Bengali Style'.Later herealized the limitations of'Bcngali Styleâ€¢.Therefore, he went back to rurture, rural life and the daily struggles of men to make art that would be realistic but modem in appearance.

 Rebel crow	Labourercouple	Famine sketch
  
 In 1943, he painted a series of sketches on the man-made famine, which had spread throughout Bengal.The famine killed thousands of people.The devastating famine touched his heart.He used Chinese ink and brush and drew sketches of the devastations of the famine on cheap packing paper. The series of those sketches are known as 'Famine Sketches'. Through those sketches, he drew the helplessness and deprivation of the poor people, their miseries and death without having food. He painted those starving people who were dying by the roadside. These sketches are his most remarkable works, which spread his name and fame around the world as a famous and humanitarian artist. Abedin not only documented the famine but also showed its sinister face through skeletal figures of people fated to die of starvation. He depicted the inhuman story with very human emotions. These drawings became iconic images of human sufferings. These sketches helped him to find his way into a realistic approach that focused on human sufferings, struggle and protest. Through a 65 feet scroll, he depicted the mass movement of 1969 and with a 30 feet scroll painting called 'Monpura'; he showed the devastating cyclone of 1970 and the sufferings of the people. Through the later sketch, he remembered the people who died in that calamity.
 In 1975, Zainul Abedin set up a folk museum at Sonargaon and a gallery in Mymensingh named Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin Museum. He became actively involved in a movement to preserve the heritage of Bengal and reintroduce Bengal art from the roots of Bengali culture. He passed away on 28 May, 1976 in Dhaka.

 Culturally rich Bangladesh is the homeland of an artist whose fame took him across the border and honoured him with different national and international awards. Have you heard about Partha Pratim Majumder? He is a maestro performer of miming art.
 If food is the nutrition for a body, art is the nutrition of soul. To keep the souls alive and fresh different arts like music, dance, paintings have evolved during the ancient time. Humankind has tried to express himself from the very beginÂ­ ning of civilization. These expressions have taken the forms of art with the touch of his creativity in expressing the untold in silence. It is an art of depicting a character, mood, idea, or narration through gestures and bodily movements without any utterance. This ancient dramatic entertainment represents the primiÂ­ tive time when people would use signs as a medium of communication.
 In Bangladesh, the boy named Partha Pratim Mojumder from Pabna overwhelmed people with this Art. He left people mesmerized by his graceful presentations of art of silence. It was like a new era in theatre art in Bangladesh when Partha came with effort to make people look at their everyday experience, but in a new form. He made people reveal meanings for all trivial things of life which they usually would overlook. He used to depict stories of sadness, laughter, different characters, birds, insects or even animals through his miming. Some of his topics are the portrayal of a thief stealing, one-sided love, picking up flower and hurting it, delicate changes in nature etc. His actions often led audience to their conscience on different issues. He is regarded as the pioneer of miming in Bangladesh.
 Partha cherished a passion for art from his very childhood. He was born in a very cultural minded family on 18 January in 1954. His photographer father nurtured him as a passionate lover of art. The family resided in a village called Kalachandpara. There used be a lot of cultural programmes in Kalachandpara in those days which had an impeccable influence on Partha's affection for art.
 Destiny introduced Partha to a mime artist Mr. Jogesh Dutta in 1966 when he went to live at his aunt's home in Chandernagar, 30 kilometres away from Kolkata. Partha could foresee his future and got admission in Mr. Dutta's mime academy in Kolkata. The major lift up of his life was when he presented a solo
  
 performance at Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy in 1979. The then French Ambassador in Bangladesh Mr. Loic Moreau, having observed his talent as an audience in that programme, offered him a scholarship at France.
 Partha took all the opportunities to learn from Mr. Etienne Decroux and Mr. Marcel Marceau, both of whom were legendary genius of miming at that time in Paris. He was trained in the mime school called 'Ecole Internationale de Mimodrame de Paris Marcel Marceau'. Gradually he became a very busy artist performing in Europe and America and he was highlighted in media too. Later on this Bangladeshi legendary mime artist received 'the Moliere Award' in the year 2009 which is the highest honourable accolade in the French Theatre. Next year, he was honoured with 'Ekushey Padak' for the contributing to Bangladesh. He was also awarded with Chevalier de l'odre des Art et des Letters' (Knight in the order of Arts and Humanities) in 2012 for his contribution all over the world.
 This great artist is now looking forward to opening an international miming institute in Bangladesh. We hope more Partha Pratim Majumder comes out from the dream institution.

 Mother Teresa was moved by the sight of the sick and dying on the streets of Kolkata. She founded a home for the dying destitute and named it 'Nirmal Hriday', meanmg 'Pure Heart'. She and her fellow nuns brought the dying people off the streets ofKolkata to this home. They were lovingly looked after and cared for. Since then many men, women and children have been taken from the streets and carried to Nirmol Hriday. These unloved and uncared for people get an opportunity to die in an environment of kindness and love. In their last hours they get human and divine love, and can feel they are also children of God. The
 Missionaries of Charity try to find jobs for those who survive, or send them to r-ri
 homes where they can live happily for some more years in a caring environment.
  
 Regarding commitment to family, Mother Teresa said, ""May be in our own family, we have somebody, who is feeling lonely, who is feeling sick, who is feeling worried. Axe we there? Axe we willing to give until it hurts in order to be with our families, or do we put our interest first? We must remember that love begins at home and we must also rem.ember that future of h\Jrnanity passes through the family"".

 Steven Paul Jobs ( 24 February 1955 - 5 October 2011) , most popularly lmown as Steve Jobs was the co-founder, chairman and chief executive officer of Apple Inc. He was the pioneer of the personal computer revolution. He was famous for his career in the electronic field of computers and consumers. This became possible through the marketing of Apple computers.
 In 1985, Jobs left Apple after losing a power battle with the board of directors. He then founded NeXT, a computer platform development company specializing in the higher education and business market. Apple, howover failed to bring up any new operating system during Job's absence. Jobs returned to Apple as an adviser, and took control
 of the company as an interim CEO.
 By 1998, Jobs brought Apple back to profitability from the verge of bankruptcy. He supervised the development of iMac, iTunes, iPod, iPhone and iPad. These devices are so simple and user friendly that even a child can operate them.
  
 He supervised the company's Apple Stores, iTunes Stores and the App Stores too. The success of these products and services brought about steady financial returns for several years and pushed Apple to become the world's most valuable publicly traded company in 2011. This triumph is regarded as the greatest turnarounds in the business history.
 Steve Jobs has been highly acclaimed as a visionary leader. He has changed people's perspective towards the computer and how they use it, consume personal media and how they communicate with each other.

30,"Jobs' Childhood
 A	Read the text and write answers to the questions that follow.
 A car mechanic Paul Jobs and his wife Clara Jobs adopted Steve who was abandoned at birth. Paul and Clara loved Steve very much. They made him feel that he was 'chosen' and very 'special'.
 One of his colleagues, Del Yocam said about Steve, ""I think his desire for complete control of whatever he makes derives directly from his personality and from the fact that he was abandoned at birth.""
 Jobs' mother taught him how to read and write before he went to the elementary school. So when he went to school, he found out that he knew everything that the teachers were teaching. He got bored and played pranks to keep himself busy. This continued for the first few years. It was clear from his behaviour that he could not accept other people's authority. He said, ""I encountered authority of a different kind that I have never encountered before, and I did not like it.""
 A turning point came when he was in grade four. His teacher Imogene Hill watched him very closely for some time and soon found out how to handle him and get things done by him. In order to get things done she used to give him money and food. One day after school, she gave Jobs a workbook with math problems in it. She said,""I want you to take it home and do this."" She showed Jobs a huge lollipop and said, ""When you are done with it, if you get it mostly right, I will give you this and five dollars. ""Within two days, Jobs solved the math problem and returned the book to his teacher.
 This continued for a couple of months and Jobs enjoyed learning so much that he did not need any return. Also he liked his teacher very much and wanted to please her. In Ms. Hill's class, Jobs felt he was special. At the end of the fourth grade, Jobs did very well. It was clear not only to Jobs and his parents but also to the teachers that he was exceptionally intelligent. The school proposed that Jobs should skip two classes and go into the seventh grade. This would mean that Jobs would find the study challenging and he would be motivated to study. His parents had him skip only one grade.

 'Heritage' is what we inherit from the past, live with in the present and then pass on to our children or future generation. Our unique source of life and inspiration is our cultural and natural heritage. When we speak of 'World Heritage', it indicates places and sites that we inherited from the past and pass on to the future generation of the entire world
 The'Shat Gambuj Mosque' in Bagerhat is sucha heritage. It became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985.
 Originally, the historic Mosque City was known as ' Khalifatabad'. It is situated at the outskirts of Bagerhat town--- not very far from the dense mangrove forest of the Sundarbans. Khalifatabad was a Muslim colony. It was founded by the Turkish general, a saint warrior Ulugh Khan Jahan in the 15111century. The infrastructure of the city reveals significant technical skills in many mosques as well as early Islamic monuments. Baked bricks were used for the construction of the buildings. The planning of the city was dominated by the tradition of Islamic architecture and the decorations were a combination of Mughal and Turkish architecture.
 Khan Jahan built a network of roads, bridges, public buildings and reservoirs to make the cityhabitable. There were about 360 mosques in the city. Among them the most remarkable is the multi-domed Shat Gombuj Mosque. The mosque is unique in the sense that it has 60 pillars that support the roof, with 77 lowheight domes. The 4 towers at 4 comers have smaller domes at the top as well. The
  
 
 vast prayer hall has 11 arched doorways on the east and 7 each on the north and south for light and ventilation. It has 7 aisles running along the length of the mosque and 11 deep curves between the slender stone columns. These columns support the curving arches created by the domes. The thickness of the arches is 6 feet and have slightly narrowing hollow and round wall.
 The west wall in the interior has 11 'mihrabs' (niche in mosque pointing towards Makkah). These mihrabs are decorated with stonework and terracotta. The floor of the mosque is made of brick.
 Besides being used as a prayer hall, Khan Jahan used the mosque as his court too.Today, it is one of the greatest tourist attractions and one of the best architectural beauties of Bangladesh.

32,"The Somapura Mahavihara
 A	Read the text.
 Paharpur is an important archaeological site situated in a village named 'Paharpur' in Naogaon district of northern Bangladesh. Naogaon is mainly plain land but in the middle ofit stood a hill covered with jungle. When the jungle was cleared and the hill excavated, there emerged a lofty ruin of an ancient temple. The temple is about 24 meter high from the surrounding level. 'Pahar' means hill. Hence the name Paharpur.
 The Paharpur site has been excavated and re-excavated a number of times by archaeologists. Sir Alexander Cunningham, archaeological surveyor of India, visited the place in 1879. He intended to carry out an extensive excavation but was prevented by the land owner. Nevertheless, he was satisfied with whatever excavation he was permitted to carry out. The site was declared to be protected by the Archaeological Survey of India in 1919 under the Ancient Monuments Preservation Act of 1904.
  
 Systematic and regular excavation started jointly by the Archaeological Survey of India, and Varendra Research Society ofR.ajshahi and Calcutta University in 1923. Theyexcavated the south-west comer of the monastery. Next, in 1925-26, historian and archaeologist RD Banerjee excavated the northern part of the cenÂ­ tral mound. From 1926-27 onward, excavation was carried out under the superÂ­ vision of KN Diksbit.
 The Deparbnent of Archaeology of Bangladesh brought the site under further excavation after independence. The operations took place in two phases. The first phase was initiated in 1981-82 and continued till 1984-1985. The second phase was started in 1988-89 and continued till 1990-91.
 Pre-liberation expeditions have revealed the architecture of a vast Buddhist monastery, the Somapura Mahavihara. It is dominated by the central shrine, attracting immediate attention by its lofty height and unusual architectural design.
 Somapura Mahavihara was one of the most famous Buddhist institutions for monks of ancient Bengal and Southern Asia The excavated complex at Paharpur has been identified as Somapura Mahavihara built by the second Pala
 king Dharmapala (781- 821 AD). Some clay seals from the rums bear the
 inscription	Shri-Somapure-Shri-Dharmapaladeva-Mahavihariyarya-bhikÂ­
 su-sangghasya.
 
 
 
 The Pala rulers were devout Buddhists and they founded a number of monasteries throughout their growing empire. Some of them became great centres of learning and their reputation quickly spread throughout Asia. Somapura Mahavihara's close relationship withthe ruling dynastyimplied that it shared the political ups and downs of its benefactors.

 The French sculptor Frederic Auguste Bartholdi was assigned to design and complete a sculpture Liberty Enlightening the World within 1876, so that it could be a gift for the Americans on the occasion of the hundredth anniversary of the American Declaration of Independence. The statue was a joint venture between the USA and France. The French people built the statue and assemble it in the States, and the people of the USA built the pedestal for the statue.
 Raising money for the pedestal was completed in August 1885. The construction of the pedestal was finished in April 1886. In the meantime, France completed the Statue in July 1884. They sent it to New York by the French war ship 'Isere' in 1885. While transporting the statue, it was split up into 350 pieces and packed in 214 crates.
  
 It took four months to put the Statue together and place it on the pedestal. Thousands of people saw the unveiling ceremony of the Statue of Liberty on 28 October 1886.
 The Freedom that the Statue stands for is not stationary. The broken chain wrapped around her feet, sticking out from the bottom of her robe, symbolizes her free forward movement, enlightening the world with her torch, free from oppression and slavery.
 The Statue's original torch was the first part constructed in 1876. It was replaced by a new copper torch covered in 24K gold leaf in 1984. The torch is lighted by flood light at night. The original torch is currently located in the lobby of the monument. Access to the torch has been closed since 1916.
 From 28 October 2011, on her 125th anniversary, the Statue of Liberty was also named ""Liberty Enlightening the World Wide Web"". The credit goes to a series of new web cams placed around her torch. Several amazing views will be just a click of a mouse away. On clear days, three cameras provide unobstructed views of scenes far and near. Two cameras provide an ultra wide-angle interactive view of the famous golden torch. The remaining camera looks downwards towards the crown of The Statue of Liberty, her face and the tablet she is holding. So a person can have access to the web cam's live feed of The Statue of Liberty from anywhere in the world.

 1		On what occasion did the French government give the Statue of Liberty to the USA?
 2	When did she reach her destination?

 1	What do you think it is?
 2	Where is this situated?
 3	Are you familiar with something like this?	Lake Baikal
 B	Read the text to find out if your guess about questions 1 and 2 is right.
 Lake Baikal is the deepest and one of the biggest and most ancient lakes of the world. It is situated almost in the centre of Asia. Lake Baikal is a gigantic bowl set at 445 meters above sea level. This grand, enormous, unusual and charming miracle of nature is located in the south of Eastern Siberia, in the Buryat Autonomous Republic and region of Irkutsk, Russia.
 The lake covers 31,500 sq km. It is 636 km long and on an average of 48 km wide. The widest point of the lake is 79.4 km. The water basin occupies 557,000 sq km. and contains 23,000 cu km (cubic kilometer) of water, which is about one fifth of the world's reservoir of fresh surface water.
 The average water level in the lake is never higher than 456m. The average depth of Lake Baikal is 730 m, and its maximum depth in the middle is 1,620 m. It would take about one year for all the rivers of the world to fill Baikal's basin, and would take four hundred years for all the rivers, streams and brooks now flowing into Siberian lakesea to do the same.
 There are hot springs in the surrounding area of Lake Baikal. The quality of the water of these springs is excellent. The lake acts as a powerful generator and bio filter producing this water. Baikal is a stormy lake. Autumn is the most stormy time. The wind blows in various directions.
 The weather depends on the wind. If it is blowing from the north, the weather is bright and sunny. The water of the lake looks green and dark blue. But if the winds get stronger, Baikal turns black, waves rise high with white crest. The beauty of Lake Baikal is exceptional.

 in life. Is that always true? Why/Why not?
 B		Read the text. It is about a young entrepreneur, Sayeed Kamal Notice what he thinks about job and happiness. Then answer the questions that follow.
 I know you will wonder if I say the best thing that everhappened
 to me was when I left my lastjob.. f1	1.i!
 Yes, really!
 
 I was a desk clerk in an office. But believe me I never likedmy job. Nothing can be more boring than being stuck in an office all day with computers and telephone.
 So after two years or so, I decided to leave my job though I had a good salary. Now I'm the owner of a nursery. Planting seeds, budding, grafting, taking care of saplings, cleaning the flower beds and spending time with trees are different parts of my full time job. I start work very early. In summer I usually leave home at 5:30 in the morning, but in winter not until about 7. I've a small hut in my nursery. There cannot be any more pleasure for me than when I see the moon from there or walk through the trees in the soft moonlit night. The winter is just over. So I'm cleaning up the winter flower garden. Now I'm busy producing more timber and medicinal plants which people will buy from July. Every
 season is so different and I love them all. When I compare my present days with the past, I simply can't understand how I could survive in my previous job. I love nature. I just love working outside in the open air after all those months in a stuffy office. Gadgets never attract me and perhaps never will.
 rm not married. I do my own work, even cook my own food. I try not to depend on others for the work which I myself can do. Oftenmy friends are annoyed with me. They say, I should engage a maid for household chores. They are not happy to see me in this 'rustic life'. They are professionals. They earn a lot Maybe

 much more than what I do, but I think I enjoy my work more.
 At weekends, I often go to the countryside. Sometimes with my friends, sometimes alone. I love collecting unknown saplings. I have another hobby. I love collecting stamps. I have a Russian stamp from the period of Lenin. I don't watch TV.
 The only problem I face is I do not earn enough money in all seasons. The winter and the monsoon are two busy seasons for me. But it's OK. Maybe I do not earn enough like many other people around me. But I at least earn enough for my family, employees, and myself to run a decent life. I must say I'm a very happy man!
 Questions:
 1	What is the best thing that ever happened to this man?
 2	Why didn't Kamal like his last job?
 3	What are the advantages and disadvantages of his present job?
 4	When does he earn most money?
 5	What attitude of Kamal is reflected in the lines: 'Maybe I do not earn much like many other people around me. But I at least earn enough for my family, employees, and me to run a decent life'?
 C	Ask and answer questions about Kamal. Use the clues given.

 What type of job do you want to have? Is it a highly paid and high-profile conventional job most people lib? Yes, you can have it. It is matter of your choice and 1111 important decision that would help you advauce in your life.But haveyouever1houghtof othertypesofjobsoutthere- cool, fun, exciting, even strange or weml jobs you never knew existed? What are they? Did you ever wonder who picks up1he chewing gum left on a pai:k bench or who assesses whe!hcr a piece of furniture is comforlable enough or who con.sb:ucts glasseyeÂ­ ball$ or who farms oysters in the middle of 1he ocean? These are all odd. unexpected. wild, unconventional, atmnge or just plain weird jobs and careers. They are not your 1radi.tionsl career choices, but somebody out there does all
 tw:scthings, gets pa.idfor it, and enjoys lifelike anybodyelse.
 There are hundreds of such jobs to take if you want to travel the less taken
 ways of life.You have to decide OD.several questions:
  
 â€¢	What companies will recruit/hire me?
 â€¢	Do I actually get a paycheck?
 â€¢	What type of education/diploma will I need?
 â€¢	Can I make a living doing this?
 Your answers to these questions will help draw your career roadmap and help you decide if you are ready to take the challenge. Decide if you want a change.

 Do you have interests beyond writing memos and attending boring meetings? If so, you may wonder how you can find a strange job. Hobbies are a good place to start. What do you do for fun? Do you stuff animals, act like Charlie Chaplin, or make model cars? There are people out there working in fields, making money off their hobbies. May be they are testing mountaineering equipment, developing fragrances, or saving sea turtles. And they are getting paid good wages too.

 Yes. Daisies, violets, tulips, marigolds, dahlias, lilies, jasmines, roses and all those things of beauty can also earn you a living if you handle them professionally. If you start such a profession you will be called a florist. A florist's career is a good choice as an unconventional job for many around the world. Wherever you see eye-catching floral displays, you actually see the professional performance of a floral designer. Using both real and artificial flowers with other greeneries, florists prepare flower displays for a variety of events such as weddings, birthdays, anniversaries, Valentine's day, official receptions and even funerals. Every flower comes with its distinct colour, design, value and meaning which flower designers have to know well. There are conventions and meanings associated with flowers. We know that conventionally roses are meant for romance and marriage anniversaries and tulips for birthdays.
 Although formal education or a diploma is not always essential for florists, they must have good taste, a good eye for colours, shapes and proportion. They have to have good sense for selecting flowers, ribbons and other accessories to make beautiful arrangements. Professional florists are knowledgeable about not only flowers but also designs and techniques. Most florists learn the trade mainly through apprenticeship in a flower farming job and also by attending formal floral schools and courses. However, a true passion for flowers and a bit of aesthetic sense are all that can make a florist's career successful.
 Flower designers earn fairly handsome money. But the bonus is that they work in a fresh and beautiful environment which their clients also enjoy. They work with flowers all day long in a pleasant and fragrant atmosphere with vivid colours around.
 Questions
 1	How is the career of a florist?
 2	What qualities do you need to have for a florist's job?
 3	How do most florists learn the trade?
 4	What is the extra advantage of a florist's job?
 D	Suppose you have met a florist in a flower shop. Write an imaginary interview with him/her.
 E	Write a short paragraph giving reasons why you like or don't like the job of a florist.

38,"I Have a Dream
 A	Read these texts and say what is common among them.
 
  
 Hi, I'm Moitry Mutsuddi. My father is a freedom fighter and my mother is a teacher. They both dream for a golden Bangladesh and inspire me to do something significant, something positive for the country. Often I think what to do to fulfil their expectations in future. Finally I've decided to be a politician and work for my motherland. How is it?
 
 
 I'm Amitabho Kar. When I say to my friends that I would like to be a space traveller, they laugh. But I really want to be that. If people from other countries can conquer the moon, and roam in the space, why not we? To be honest, I visualise that one day I'm stepping on Mars from	a space shuttle. Please wish me the best so that my dream comes true.
  
 Hello! I'm Mofakkhar Hasan. I live in a slum with my parents and sisters. I know how cruel poverty can be! My heart bleeds to see the poor, suffering people in my slum. After I have finished my education, I'll be a social worker and fight against social injustice and poverty. 'Change' is the word I believe in to make Bangladesh a golden Bengal.
 
 
 My name is Ruth Antara Chowdhury. I believe that a society cannot be enlightened without proper education. Education lights the candle in people's heart. So I will be a teacher. Some people appreciate my decision but some people say teachers are not reverred properly nowaday. I tell them, I don't care who tell what. I want to be a teacher because I'm brilliant. Teachers need to be creative and innovative.
  
 
 B		Read the texts again and then work in pairs. Which person do you think is most like you and why? Write a similar text stating your own dream.
 C		Read this interview between Swati, a successful student in JSC and a newspaper reporter, Animesh Roy. The interview is jumbled up. Read the text and then organise the conversation properly.
  
 
 Animesh : So you mean learning from each other?
 Swati: There is no magic behind my success. I just worked hard. I followed our teachers' advice, 'The more you read, the more you learn'. I'm grateful to my teachers and parents for guiding me properly.
 Animesh : Well Swati, we are really so proud of you for your brilliant performance in the JSC exams. Please tell us how you could achieve this success.
 Swati  : Ohh....and I'm grateful to my school and friends too. Animesh  : That's great!
 Swati : In my school, we had a nice study group. Whenever we had any problem, we discussed it in our group first. We tried to help each other. And it always worked. Never forget, two heads are better than one.
 Animesh : I understand why you are grateful to your school but would you explain how you are grateful to your friends, please?
 Swati : Exactly that!
 Animesh : By the way, Swati, what are your dreams for the future?
 Swati : To keep up the success in next exams and make my dreams come true. I want to be a scientist. Since my childhood I've known that many people in Bangladesh are under arsenic threat. They are taking arsenic directly from their drinking water and indirectly from the crops and vegetables they eat. It's a kind of slow poisoning. People are helpless. They are suffering from many kinds of diseases. Therefore, I have a dream to carry out a research on how to get rid of this problem, using our own recourses and expertise.
 Animesh	: Wish you luck.

 Now, why has Kalam put so much importance to the issue of energy? The energy sources have always been a major factor of change throughout history. The world's petroleum consumption has increased from 3 billion barrels annually in 1930 to 37 billion barrels annually today. In the next quarter century, the world's population is expected to be about 8 billion which is 30 percent higher than today. Developing countries will grow their economies about two times faster than industrialised countries. Global economic growth is expected to continue at 3 percent per year. Consequently, the global demand for energy will grow at about 1.7 percent per year on an average. It indicates a 50-percent rise of energy consumption by 2030. If the world's daily petroleum consumption is 100 million barrels now, it will rise to 150 million barrels by that time. The present reserve of hydro-carbon energy resources is limited and it will not be sufficient to meet the future energy challenges of the world. Hence, leading industrial countries have taken initiatives to use alternative energy sources mainly known as green or renewable energy sources. The bottom line of Kalam's speech indicates the concern of mankind in the 21st century.

 E	'Massive burning of world's coal reserves may lead to a worldwide ecological disaster ...'--- Do you support this view? Explain why/why not.
 F	In Sohan's village, some people headed by Mr Asadul Islam came from an organisation to hold a meeting at the local Union Parishad (UP) Office. Their objective was to introduce alternative power supply systems in rural households. Read the dialogue between the UP Chairman and Mr Islam.
 
 Chairman	What's your alternative power supply system?
 Mr Islam	Well, it's solar power and we are going to use solar power units in rural areas.
 Chairman	What is it? Is it something new?
 Mr Islam  Not exactly. It's already familiar in many parts of the world. We've introduced it in our country too. But yes, in this locality it's something new.
 Chairman   I see. Why do you call it 'alternative power supply system'?
 Mr Islam  Because solar power is a substitute for conventional electricity. It's actually a renewable energy source. Our solar units can be installed on open roof tops or at any open place where sunlight is available.
 Chairman  Sounds good. How much electricity can they give? Can they run my irrigation pump?

 Mr Islam  I'm afraid Mr Chairman, they can't. Our solar panels are small and are designed for domestic purposes only. They can produce enough electricity to run say, two or three tube lights, two fans, a TV set and the like. But larger units can run...
 Chairman  Sorry to interrupt Mr Asad. I've to go to the bus stand now to receive a friend. Anyway, several villages in our Union are still without electricity. I hope people will welcome your 'alternative power supply system'.
 Mr Islam :	 Thank you, Mr Chairman. Goodbye. Chairman :	Goodbye, Mr Islam. See you again.
 G	True or False? If false, write the correct answer.
 1		Alternative power supply system is a completely new system m our country.
 2	A renewable energy source can be a substitute for conventional electricity.
 3	Solar power units of Mr Islam are for commercial use only.
 H	What questions would you like to ask Mr Islam about solar panel, solar unit, energy sources, 'alternative power supply system', its capacity, its advantages and disadvantages, etc? Make a list of your probable questions.
 I	Role play. Work in pairs. You take the role of the Chairman and your partner the role of Mr Islam. Rewrite the dialogue and act it out.

43,"Renewable Energy Sources (Part 2)
 A	Look at the following pictures and discuss with your partner what you see in them. How are the two pictures related to each other?
 
 B	Read the text and answer the following questions.
 Countries of the world rely heavily on petroleum, coal and natural gas for their energy sources. There are two major types of energy sources: renewable and non-renewable. Hydro-carbon or fossil fuels are non-renewable sources of energy. Reliance on them poses real big problems. First, fossil fuels such as oil, coal, gas etc, are finite energy resources and the worldeventually will run out of them. Secondly, they will become too expensive in the coming decades and too damaging for the environment. Thirdly, fossil fuels have direct polluting impacts on earth's environment causing global warming. In contrast, renewable energy sources such as, wind and solar enezgy are constantly and naturally replenished and never run out.
 Most renewable energy comes either directly or indirectly from the sun. Sunlight or solar energy can be used for heating and lighting homes, for generating electricity and for other commercial and industrial uses.
 The sun's heat drives the wind and this wind energy can be captured with wind turbines to produce electricity. Then the wind and the sun's heat cause water to evaporate. When the water vapour turns into rain or snow and flows downhill into rivers or streams, its energy can be captured as hydroelectric energy.
 Along with the rain and snow, sunlight causes plants to grow. Plants produce biomass which again can be turned into fuels such as fire wood, alcohol, etc that are called bioenergy.
  
 Scientists have identified Hydrogen as another form of renewable energy source. It is the most abundant element in nature. But it does not exist separately as a gas. It is always combined with other elements, such as with oxygen to make water. Hydrogen, separated from another element, can be burned as a fuel to produce electricity.
 Our Earth's interior contains molten lava which gives off extreme heat. This heat inside the Earth produces steam and hot water which can be used as geothermal energy to produce electricity for heating homes, etc.
 Ocean energy comes from several sources. Ocean's force of tide and wave can be used to produce energy. The surface of the ocean gets more heat from the sun than the ocean depths. This temperature difference can be used as energy source too.

 Questions
  
 What are you reading, Raju?
 English, Uncle. A chapter on renewable energy sources.
 I see. Do you know renewable energy is also called green energy?
 Green energy?... No Uncle, I don't know. Nothing is there about green energy in the text either.
 Are you sure? Anyway, renewable energy sources provide us with energy which doesn't harm environment during its production or consumption. Say, solar energy. You see, there's no burning, no smoke, no emission of gases. It's a sort of clean technology and clean energy source.
 Oh exactly. That's what our teacher said, I remember.
 On the other hand, burning fossil fuels, say oil or coal, emits greenhouse gases that harm the environment.
 0	... I see. Yes, I've got the clue, Uncle. Thanks a lot. I now understand the relation between the two pictures in section A. Green energy sources make a green globe.

 2	'Nothing is there about green energy in the text either'. --- Do you think this statement of Raju is correct? Explain why yes/no.
 3	'I now understand the relation between the two pictures in section A'. What does Raju mean here? What does he really understand? Do you agree with Raju's view here? Why?
 E	Read the dialogue and act it out in pairs.
 A	: What's solar energy?
 B	: It's one of the renewable energy sources.
 A	: Why is it called green energy?
 B	: Well, it's green energy because it helps us keep the Earth green. I mean it doesn't emit any pollutants in the atmosphere when we produce and use it.
  
 A	: I see. Then it must be a clean source of energy.
 B	: Exactly. And that's why it's also called clean energy.

 Eid is the main religious festival of the Muslims iri Bangladesh. Eid means happine99. Bveyone want.a to share this happiness with near and dear ones. So mostof the people, who areliving outside their homesfordifferent reasons have a strong desire to get ha.ck home during lhe Eid vacation. As a result, there is a mad IU9h to board buses. trains, or laull(:bes for goinghome.This often causes
 tmnsport accidents that take away many lives. However, these cannot step people from going home to meet their family, in-laws, or friends. What makes people rush for their homes in 8l)ite of serious hazards? This is nothing but people's desire to returnto the roots. Dohuman beings have roots like the trees? The amwer is 'yes' but unlike the roots of the trees they are invisible, they lie in our minds. It'sthese roots that make a bond 'between us and tamil.y
  
 members, in-laws, friends, neighbours or even between us and the land where we were born and grew up. In that sense our families, our land of birth, relatives, our culture, traditions, or surroundings are our roots. And wherever we stay, we feel the power of our roots. It's our roots that develop our identity making us what we are. When we lose that bond, we become rootless. Human beings who do not have any roots are a non-entity. In other words, they do not have an identity. They don't know where they are from, and/or where they are heading to. This often makes them feel empty and lost.

 Mainul Islam is a qualified farmer in Naogaon. Mr Islam was very brilliant as a student. He took his higher education from Bangladesh Agricultural University in Mymensingh. He then came back home and started advanced farming. He has two other brothers who are graduates in different disciplines. The specialty of the Islam family is that they all are living in their village and all are renowned in their own fields. Mr. Islam's younger brother, who is a Rajshahi University graduate, is a science teacher in a local school. His youngest brother is a social science graduate who likes to start a local NGO to work for this area. When asked ""What makes you decide to stay here in this village?"" Mr Islam smiled and said, ""Look, it's true that we could leave this village for city life. I could be banker or my brothers could be bureaucrats. But it didn't attract us. We are sons of this soil. Yes, we have education but does education prepare a person only to be an officer? Don't we have any obligation to the soil that has made us what we are?"" He also added that not every educated individual should be a job seeker. He added that since his discipline was agriculture, after his education he took the occupation of a farmer. In response to a question whether they had any frustration living in a village, he confirmed that they were indeed very pleased with their life. He said, ""I work in my own farm, stay with my family members, pass time with my old friends, and sleep at my own home. All these count a lot.""
 Mr Islam is right. Many people go to cities and forget or loosen their roots knowingly or unknowingly. Mr Islam and his brothers are great-they haven't forgotten their roots. They not only stuck to their own roots, they have been torch bearers for others to be respectful of their roots.

 A Read the following text.
 Michael Madhusudan Dutt, was a celebrated 19th century Bangalee poet and dramatist. He was born in Sagordari on the bank of the Kopotaksho River, a village in Keshabpur Upazila under Jashore district.
 From an early age, Michael aspired to be an Englishman in form and manner. Though he was born in a sophisticated Hindu family, he converted to Christianity as a young man, much to the ire of his family, and adopted the
 first name Michael. In his childhood, he was recognised by his teachers as a precious child with a gift of literary talent. His early exposure to English education and European literature at home and his college inspired him to imitate the English in taste, manners and intellect.
 Since his adolescence he started believing that he was born on the wrong side of the planet, and that his society was unable to appreciate his talent. He also
 '""""'I  believed that the West would be more receptive to his
  
 
 "":a
  
 creative genius.
  
 Madhusudan was an ardent follower of the famous English poet Lord Byron. So after adopting Christianity, he went to Europe and started composing poems and plays in English. They showed his higher level of intellectual ability. However, he failed to gain the right appreciation. To his utter frustration he found that he was not esteemed as a native writer of English literature. Out of his frustration, he composed a sonnet in Bangla ""Kopotaksha Nad"" which earned him huge reputation in Bangla. Gradually he could realise that his true identity lay in Bengal and he was a sojourner in Europe. Afterwards he regretted his fascination for England and the West. He came back to Bengal and devoted himself to Bangla literature from this period. He has written the first Bangla epic Meghnad BadhKabya.

 DearAvajon
 Often I'm so sorry to see the city's footpaths occupied by floating people. They are living in some makeshift shacks. I simply cannot think how father, mother grandfather, grandmother and kids-all live in such a tinyplace. Within the few square yards in their possession they sleep , socialise , cook and even beautify themselves. These people are living in such an inhuman condition! This cannot be the picture of life in a civilized society. Also they are polluting the area. They are leastbothered about their health and hygiene.Out of curiosity, I talked to some of these people. They have their own homes and identity in their own village. They are here thinking that life in the city will be better. What an irony! Can't the society or the state do anything for these people? However, I must admit that I'm amazed to see how they sometimes tidy up their places especially in the evening! Home, sweet home after all !
 Mithun
 
 DearMitbun
 Iunderstand yourconcern. The movement of people from the rural areas to the urban areas isa big social problem in many countries like ours. These floating people are definitely a burden to the cities where they migrate. When the number is huge, it is difficult for any state to rehabilitate them quickly. See from the other side. The people you have referred to have lost their roots and they are unable to assimilate in the new culture. Maybe many of them are attracted by the charm of the cities, but I'm sure it was a need to many others. People become rootless sometimes due to climate change, river erosion, social discrepancies, or poverty. However, you cannot solve this problem overnight. But you can certainly take steps to improve their lifestyle. Why don't you form a committee with other young people in your locality that will teach them basic health and hygiene? It may help them to minimise pollution. Give it a try.
 Yours

Some services like Facebook allow users to update their profiles. Fourthly, networks allow users to post blog entries. User profiles have a section dedicated to comments from friends and other users.

 What worlds of wonder are our books! As one opens them and looks,
 New ideas and people rise
 In our fancies and our eyes.
 The room we sit in melts away, And we find ourselves at play
 With some one who, before the end, May become our chosen friend.
 Or we sail along the page To some other land or age. Here's our body in the chair, But our mind is over there.
 Each book is a magic box,
 Which with a touch a child unlocks. In between their outside covers Books hold all things for their lovers.

52,"Two Mothers Remembered
 A	Read the poem and answer the following questions Two Mothers Remembered
 I had two Mothers - two Mothers I claim
 Two different people, yet with the same name. Two separate women, diverse by design,
 But I loved them both because they were mine. The first was the Mother who carried me here, Gave birth and nurtured and launched my career.
 She was the one whose features I bear,
 Complete with the facial expressions I wear. She gave me her love, which follows me yet, Along with the examples in life she set.
 As I got older, she somehow younger grew,
 And we'd laugh as just Mothers and daughters do. But then came the time that her mind clouded so, And I sensed that the Mother I knew would soon go. So quickly she changed and turned into the other,
 A stranger who dressed in the clothes of my Mother. Oh, she looked the same, at least at arm's length, But now she was the child and I was her strength.
 We'd come full circle, we women three,
  
 My mother the :first. the second and me.
 And if my own children should come to a day, When a new Mother comes and the old goes away, I'd ask of them nothing that I didn't do.
 Love both of your Mothers as both have loved you.

 Fonna-23) English For Today-9-10
  
 
 ""O Mary, go and call the cattle home, And call the cattle home,
 And call the cattle home
 Across the sands of Dee!""
 The western wind was wild and dank with foam, And all alone went she.
 The western tide crept up along the sand, And o'er and o'er the sand,
 And round and round the sand,
 As far as eye could see.
 The rolling mist came down and hid the land And never home came she.
 
 ""Oh! Is it weed, or fish, or floating hair, A tress of golden hair,
 A drowned maiden's hair Above the nets at sea?
 Was never salmon yet that shone so fair Among the stakes of Dee?'
 They rowed her in across the rolling foam, The cruel crawling foam,
 The cruel hungry foam,
 To her grave beside the sea:
 But still the boatman hear her call the cattle home Across the sands of Dee.
 
 Charles Kingsley

 He gives his harness bells a shake To ask if there is some mistake.

 And miles to go before I sleep, And miles to go before I sleep.

 Rosamond, a little girl about seven years old, was walking with her mother in the streets of London. As she passed along she looked in at the windows of several shops, and saw a great variety of things. She wanted to stop to look at them and buy them all, without knowing their uses or even without knowing their names.
 At first they stopped at a milliner's shop. The windows of the shop were decorated with ribbons, lace and festoons of artificial flowers.
 ""Oh, Mamma, what beautiful roses! Won't you buy some of them?"" ""No, my dear.""
 ""Why?""
 ""Because I don't want them. They are not real flowers.""
 They went a little further and came to a jeweller's shop. In it were a great many pretty, bright ornaments of little value, set beautifully behind the ""'""l glass.

 A	Read the last part of the story to see what happened to Rosamond's beautiful purple jar.
 Rosamond and her mother were going back to the chemist's shop. As they were walking, Rosamond had to stop once again to take another stone out of the broken shoe, and she often limped with pain.
 
 Forma-24, English For Today-9-10
  
 When they got back to the shop, Rosamond's mother asked her to carefully examine the jar before she bought it. But Rosamond was so excited that she bought it even without looking at what was inside the jar.
 Happily she came back home with her mother. Then Rosamond quickly brought some flowers from the garden and was going to put them into the jar. But as soon as she took the top off, she saw something dark inside, which gave off an unpleasant smell.
 ""What is it, Mamma? I didn't want this black thing and the terrible smell.""
 ""Nor did I, my dear.""
 ""But what shall I do with it?"" ""That I can't tell.""
 ""Okay, Mamma, I must pour it out and fill the jar with fresh water.""
 Then she made the jar empty. But to her great disappointment, she found that it was no longer a purple jar --- it was a plain white glass jar. With its coloured water gone, the jar did no longer look beautiful.
 Rosamond cried with tears of disappointment in her eyes. She also cried for her folly. Every day her shoes grew worse and worse, and she could neither run, dance, jump, nor go shopping with her mother.
 Thus Rosamond suffered for a whole month and learned a lesson the hard way. She hoped that she would be wiser in future.

 Once upon a time in Venice, Italy, there was a very rich merchant named Antonio. He had many ships that sailed in the sea. His ships carried different types of merchandise to other countries. He sold those goods there. He bought spices and other valuables from foreign countries and sold them in Venice.
  
 Antonio was a good and kindman. He always helped the poor. The people of Venice lovedhim very much for his honesty and kindness.
 Antoniohad a close friendnamed Bassanio. He wu a handsome young manand was bom ina noble family. Bassanio likedtolive a very luxurious life. He loved grandeur and style. He spent more money than he earned. As a result, he was very often short of money. In such situations, Bassanio would go to his best friend Antonio for help. Antonio would helphim with cash.
 It sohappened that Bassanio fellinlove witha wealthyladynamed Portia. Portia was known not only for her beauty but also for her wisdom. She was soft towards Bassanio too.Hewanted to visit Portia ina grandmannerbut hedid not have any money. So he went to Antonio.
 Bassanio said, ""Dear friend Antonio. I am in great need of some money. I would like to visit Portia at Belmont, grandly dressed and with many servants. But I don't have any money right now. Please help me to fulfill myintention.11
 Antonio said, ""This isnota problem, my friend. How much doyou need?""
 ""Three thousand ducats [Venetian CUITeD.cy] will do.'â€¢ ""I don't have 1hat much money with
 me now as all my ships have gone out in 1he sea withmerchandise. But don't worry, my friend, rn arrange three thousand ducats for you.""
 So he decided to bom>w the sum
 from a moneylender named Shylock. "" Shylock was a very crooked man. l Antonio and Shylock hated each
 other. Shylock used to lend money with high interest. He would even send the debtor to prison if the latter failed to pay his debt. On the
 contrary, Antonio used to lend money to help those who needed it and would not charge any interest.
 Shylockagreedto lendhimmoney butononecondition. Ifhe failed torepay the money in three month1s time, he would pay a penalty. Shylock would cut a pound of flesh from any part ofAntonio's body.

 B	Read the text ancl answer the questions that follow.
 Bassanio went to Belmont to visit Portia grandly dressed, with many servants. Portia's fatherhaddiedlately. Before his death hehad1hought of an1lllllSUal plan to find a good husband for his daughter. He wanted a man tomarry Portia for herself and not for her wealth. He had three caskets made, one of gold, one of silver and one of lead. One of the caskets had Portia's portrait in it. The suitor whowould first choose the casket with the portrait would marry her.
  
 
 The first one to try was the prince of Morocco. He thought that silver and lead are poor metals. It is the casket made of precious metal that can hold the precious picture. So he chose the gold casket. But all he found was a picture of a skull with a message that said, ""All that glitters is not gold."" The prince was very sad and went back home. Then came the prince of Spain. He looked at the silver casket for a long time. On it was written, ""He who chooses me will get what he deserves."" The prince had a very high opinion about himself. He thought that he deserved the best. He therefore chose the silver casket and opened it. Inside the casket he found the picture of a blinking fool. He was very disappointed and offended. He immediately rode away.
 Then it was Bassanio's tum. He looked at the caskets for a long time. He thought, "" Appearances are often misleading. Bad men appear good and they hide their inner ugliness under fine clothes."" So he chose the plain looking lead casket. On opening the casket, he found the portrait of Portia inside.
 Bassanio and Portia got married. There was great joy at Belmont and the newly married couple were spending their time happily.
 But soon their happiness turned into sorrow by a piece of news. A messenger came with a letter from Antonio. The letter said, ""Dear friend Bassanio, all my ships have been lost at sea. I cannot pay the money I owe to Shylock. So I have to pay the penalty. Dear friend, come and see me if possible. I would like to see you once before I die."" Bassanio quickly left for Venice.

 Lesson 11: The Trial
 A    Read the text and answer the questions that follow.
 When Bassanio reached Venice, Antonio was already in the court of justice. They were waiting for the trial to begin. The Duke entered the courtroom, took his seat and the trial began. The Duke requested Shylock to be merciful and not to claim his pound of flesh. But Shylock would not listen to him. Bassanio offered him twice the amount of money that Shylock lent Antonio but Shylock did not accept it. He said, ""I claim my pound of flesh. The law is on my side. Antonio must pay the penalty written in the bond.""
 The Duke was extremely sorry that he could do nothing to help Antonio. The law was on Shylock's side and the law must be abided. The Duke feared that ahhough the wisest lawyer in Venice was coming to speak in defense of Antonio, he would not be able to save the merchant Soon a young clerk entered the courtroom with a
 letter from that lawyer. The lawyer was ill and would not be able to come to the
 court.
 He requested the Duke to let his young friend, Doctor Balthazar, defend Antonio. The Duke gave his permission, and Doctor Balthazar entered the courtroom. He looked very young, and the Duke doubted if the wisdom of the young lawyer could save Antonio. This young lawyer was no other than Portia in disguise and the young clerk was her friend, who was also in disguise.
 Portia begged Shylock to be merciful and told him how God bestows mercy to those who are merciful themselves.
 "" Mercy"" Portia said, "" brings a blessing to him who shows it and to him who receives it. All of us pray to God for mercy. But God will only have mercy on us if we have mercy on others.""
 Shylock paid no heed to Portia. All he wanted was his pound of flesh.
 """"	Portia asked, ""Can't Antonio pay the debt?""
 t'-1  Bassanio cried,"" Yes, he can pay it, and even more.... Even I can pay ten
  
 
 times the sum my friend borrowed from Shylock."" ""Won't you take the money, Shylock?"" Portia asked.
 ""No, I demand the lawful penalty. Give me my pound of flesh."" ""Let me see the bond Shylock"", said Portia.
 Shylock handed the bond to her. She read it with great attention and then said,
 ""You are right Shylock. The law is on your side. You can claim the flesh. But I would request you one more time to accept the sum Bassanio is offering you, and let me tear up the bond."" But Shylock would not give up his claim. Portia then turned towards Antonio and said, ""Get ready Antonio for Shylock to cut his pound of flesh. The law gives it to him.""
 Shylock was filled with joy on hearing what Portia said. He began to praise Portia in disguise, for her wisdom and righteousness. He cried out, ""Oh noble judge! Oh excellent young man, you are a second Daniel, who has come to this earth.""
 Portia urged Shylock to cut the pound of flesh he demanded. Delighted, Shylock walked towards Antonio with a knife in hand. He told Antonio to uncover his chest. But as he was about to cut Antonio's flesh, Portia stopped him. She cried out, ""Wait a second, Shylock! Never forget - there is no mention of blood in the bond. Therefore, you cannot shed a single drop of blood while you cut your pound of flesh; or else you pay the penalty. And the penalty is, the state will take your property from you. You lose everything that you have now, Shylock.""
 Shylock understood it was not possible for him to cut a pound of flesh without shedding blood. He was defeated by the wise lawyer. He hung his head and without another word left the courtroom. Thus Antonio's life was saved.

 English Paper One Full Marks: 100
 Time: 3 hours
 (Answer all the questions. Figures in the margin indicate full marks.)
 Read the passage. Then answer the questions below.
 21 February is a memorable day in our national history. We observe the day every year as International Mother Language Day. The day is a national holiday.
 On this day, we pay tribute to the martyrs who laid down their lives to establish Bangla as a state language in undivided Pakistan in 1952. The struggle to secure the rights of our mother language is known as the Language Movement.
 The seeds of the Language Movement were sown on 21 March 1948 when Mohammad Ali Jinnah, the Governor General of Pakistan, declared in a public meeting in Dhaka that Urdu would be the only state language of Pakistan. The declaration raised a storm of protest in the eastern part of the country. The protest continued non-stop, gathering momentum day by day. It turned into a movement and reached its climax in 1952. The government outlawed all sorts of public meetings and rallies to stop it.
 The students of Dhaka University defied the law and brought out a peaceful protest procession on 21 February 1952. When the procession reached near Dhaka Medical College, the police opened fire on the students, killing Salam, Rafiq, Barkat, Safiur and Jabbar. As a result, there were mass protests all over the country and the government had to declare Bangla as a state language. This kindled the sparks of independence movement of Bangladesh.

 3.	Read the following text and fill in each gap with a suitable word based on the information of the text.	lx5=5
 
 Eveyone wants to share this happiness with near and dear ones. That's why people rush for their homes in spite of serious hazards? This is nothing but people's desire to return to the roots. Do human beings have roots like the trees? The answer is 'yes' but unlike the roots of the trees they are invisible, they lie in our minds. It's these roots that make a bond between us and family members,
  
 
 in-laws, friends, neighbours or even between us and the land where we were born and grew up. In that sense our families, our land of birth, relatives, our culture, traditions, or surroundings are our roots. And wherever we stay, we feel the power of our roots. It's our roots that develop our identity making us what we are. When we lose that bond, we become rootless. Human beings who do not have any roots are a non-entity. In other words, they do not have an identity. They don't know where they are from, and/or where they are heading to. This often makes them feel empty and lost.
 By nature, human beings love a)_	to share their feelings with near and dear ones. This invisible b) _	for each other lies in our hearts. It always pulls us to c) _	back to our roots. It develops our identity and d) _ us to know who we are. Ifwe deny our roots, we will deny our existence. So, we can't but e) _ our roots.

 Suggested Answer:
 Global Warming
 Global warming is now a major worldwide concern. It is the gradual warming of the air surrounding the earth as a result of heat being trapped by environmental pollution. There are many factors responsible for it. Firstly, the destruction and burning down of tropical rain forests; secondly, traffic that clogs up city streets; thirdly, the rapid growth of industries and the use of CFC; fourthly, the use of detergents. As a result, the world is heating up. However the main culprit
  
 
 is the carbon dioxide gas produced by the burning of fossil fuels and forests. All these are responsible for global warming as well as climatic change. The effects of global warming are very alarming for our life and existence. Because of global warming the temperatures may have risen by as much as 4Â° C. It could severely reduce mankind's ability to grow food; destroy wildlife and damage wilderness, raise sea levels and flood coastal areas and farmland. It is a severe threat to our life and existence. So to save the globe and to live a healthy life we should come forward to stop environmental pollution and the emission of green house gases. To ensure a green environment we should plant trees and stop destruction of forests. A green environment can ensure healthy and danger free life. We all should work hand in hand to save the globe from the harmful effects of climate change .

 It was on the first day of Boishakh. Dulal came out of his house in the morning with all his family members. Their first destination was the Ramna Park. In the park, there were people of all ages. Dulal could see a group of foreigners too. One of them had a camera and he was clicking all the way. All of a sudden, he came near Dulal.....................
 Suggested answer:
 ................................................and in a sweet yet strange voice said, 'Shubho Nababorsho'.
 Dulal felt excited. 'who taught you to say that'? asked Dulal. 'I have heard people saying it everywhere in the garden'.
 The camera-happy man was from Norway. He said, 'Look, we are friends now. I will give you a small book that contains general info about my country. But please tell me about this day. I have visited many places of the world but I have never seen such a festive rally of people'.
 'Do you like it'? Dulal asked. 'It's fantastic and exciting'.
 Dulal guided the foreigner to the Institute of Fine Arts. The huge new year procession was about to start with all kinds of colorful masks. Dulal started telling the man about the motifs of the masks. All on a sudden, he remembered that his parents must be frantically looking for him. In a nervous tone Dulal said, 'Sorry, I have to go'. Without waiting for the foreigner's response, he started	r-ri running to Ramna Park to meet his parents.

 11.	Suppose, you are Rayan/Afsana. Yesterday something amazing happened to you which you can't but share with your friend, Abrar/Pranto. Now, write an e-mail to Abrar/ Pranto about the incident.

 Suggested answer:
 To: zahiddrmc@gmai1.com Subject: Sharing patriotism
 
 Dear Pranto,
 I know it may not have time to read my mail as you are extremely busy with your study tour. But I believe the story will move you greatly.
 
 Yesterday morning, I was heading towards my school to take an exam in a rickshaw. Everything around was so quiet that I felt a little scared. On my way, I saw some paper flags lying on the roadside. I remembered that yesterday was 16th December. Suddenly, the grey bearded puller stopped the rickshaw, got down and sprinted down the road. I was so terrified that I couldn't utter a single word. But I noticed that in a minute he returned with those flags. Composing myself, I told him that I was quite moved by his action. Taking a deep breath, he said, ""Look, these are the flags for which I fought risking my life. So, I can't allow anyone to step on them."" I realized that this patriotic zeal made the victory possible in 1971. My eyes became wet with tears. I believe it's time for all ofus to play our part in realising the dreams of our indomitable freedom fighters for which they sacrificed their lives and limbs. Hope to hear from you.
 
 With love Afsana
