    "text = 'The crossing is presently closed. It was briefly opened on Saturday morning to allow the first convoy of 20 trucks, laden with vital supplies, to cross into Gaza.According to Egyptian authorities at the Rafah crossing, 13 trucks were carrying medicine and medical supplies, five were carrying food and two trucks had water.While many international organizations welcomed the short reopening, aid workers say the supplies are a fraction of what’s required for the 2.2 million people crammed into Gaza under a blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt.The United States has been pressuring Egypt to establish a humanitarian corridor for civilians in Gaza, as well as for foreigners. Egypt has said it won’t allow refugees to flood its territory and has instead insisted that Israel allow it to deliver aid to Gazans.TOPSHOT - Smoke billows after an Israeli air strike in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip on October 16, 2023. The death toll from Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip has risen to around 2,750 since Hamass deadly attack on southern Israel last week, the Gaza health ministry said October 16. Some 9,700 people have also been injured as Israel continued its withering air campaign on targets in the Palestinian coastal enclave, the Hamas-controlled ministry added. (Photo by SAID KHATIB / AFP) (Photo by SAID KHATIB/AFP via Getty Images) They followed evacuation orders. An Israeli airstrike killed them the next day. Opening of the border is a complicated matter given the number of parties involved. It requires the approval of Egypt and Hamas, which directly control the crossing, as well as an okay from Israel, which has been bombing Gaza, including Rafah’s vicinity. Egypt has demanded assurances that Israel won’t bomb aid convoys.There are around 200 trucks at the border waiting to get into Gaza and negotiations are ongoing between Israel and the US for an agreement that could allow more aid to get in.The 20 trucks which crossed the Rafah border from Egypt to deliver aid to Gaza on Saturday were carrying food, water and medical supplies, but no fuel.Head of communications for the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing, Wael Abu Mohsen, told Saudi state media Al Hadath TV in an interview Saturday that fuel was not delivered, “despite fuel supplies running dangerously low at hospitals and schools in Gaza.'"
