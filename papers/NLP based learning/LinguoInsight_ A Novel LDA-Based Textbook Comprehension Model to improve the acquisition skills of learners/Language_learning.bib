	abstract = {The widespread use of mobile devices and the wider coverage of wireless networks offer the educational sectors various alternatives in enhancing learning and teaching. Mobile assisted language learning (MALL) emerges from this trend and draws traction from relevant stakeholders. While much research has been done on the application of mobile technologies in promoting language learning, and the educational practices that foster that learning approach, relatively little empirical evidence has been given to understand the acceptance and use of MALL by higher education learners, particularly in the context of a developing country. This study sought to fill this gap by applying the modified version of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). Survey data from 293 higher education learners from Vietnam were analyzed by the Rasch-based path model. Results indicated the important roles of attitude and performance expectancy in predicting learners' behavior intention and their usage of MALL. Facilitating condition was found to have no direct effect on learners' usage of MALL, representing a departure from the literature. The findings offered implications regarding the use of the UTAUT as an appropriate model for examining MALL acceptance, the improvement of technical and organizational supports, as well as the need for more empirical studies on the instructional approaches that foster the use of MALL, particularly in the context of a developing country like Vietnam.},

However, there is little research that examines the dimensions of mobile learning for both researchers and instructional designers and focuses on effective uses of the latest mobile learning technologies for education. There have been no reviews of research on mobile English learning. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the research on Mobile English Language Learning (MELL) material to initiate an evidence-based discussion on the usage of mobile learning in English language education. Findings from existing literature show that studying and reviewing mobile learning leads to a deeper understanding of its effect and possibilities with respect to learning the English language. Additionally, findings also indicate that when it comes to English language skills, vocabulary is the most-used skill, and the most common problem that studies mention is that of motivation. Further studies need to investigate other terms and keywords that reflect on the use of mobile learning.},

The methodology is a case study analysis of students’ needs, with statistical processing of the collected data. The results reveal that foreign language learning, particularly studying and revising English vocabulary and phrases via smartphones is effective in the enhancement of university students’ performance. However, such learning must be designed around students’ needs and continuously facilitated by a teacher. Only then can it contribute to positive learning outcomes. In addition, the results also confirm that mobile learning can serve as an appropriate complementary method to other forms of course delivery. Further research should extend the mobile app to the Apple platform and iOS.},

Twenty-eight university lecturers participated in the semi-structured interviews and expressed their opinions on how mobile technologies impacted the nature of teaching and learning in tertiary education. In particular, four themes associated with teaching English in the context of mobile technologies were discussed: (1) technology mediation, (2) disruptive pedagogy, (3) English teaching, and (4) learning flexibility. The results show that mobile technology and pedagogical innovation are not challenging for teachers. Instead, psychological anxiety, extended pedagogical roles, and learning flexibility are the challenging issues. Based on the results, a theoretical framework for digital education and a learning model for digital native students are proposed. This study suggests further work to promote pedagogy that connects students with higher-level thinking.},

Technology is having an impact on how instruction is delivered and how information is found and share. Until very recently, the educational models encouraged memorization as an essential learning skill. These days, technologies have changed the educational model and access to information. Knowledge is available online, mostly free, and easily accessible. Reading, sharing, listening and, doing are currently necessary skills for education. Mobile devices have become a complete set of applications, support, and help for educational organizations. By conducting an analysis of the behavior and use of mobile devices on current students, efficient educational applications can be developed. Although there are several initiatives for the use of mobile learning in education, there are also issues linked to this technology that must be addressed. In this work, we present the results of a literature review of mobile learning; the findings described are the result of the analysis of several articles obtained in three scientific repositories. This work also lists certain issues that, if properly addressed, can avoid possible complications to the implementation of this technology in education.},

	abstract = {With the proliferation of technology and the Internet, the way education is delivered has undergone a rapid change in different educational settings. Whilst a large amount of research has investigated the implementation of mobile technologies in education, there is still a paucity of research from a teaching perspective across disciplines within higher education. For this reason, this study investigated the acceptance, preparedness and adoption of mobile technologies by academic faculties within higher education, using the context of China. Underpinned by the extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) Model, a large-scale quantitative survey investigated the factors affecting academics’ behavioural intentions and use for mobile technologies, and variations between different demographic groups. Findings suggested that the most significant factors affecting academics’ behavioural intention and behaviours of use were their performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation and habit. Behavioural intention also affected how the faculty staff used their mobile technologies. Moreover, gender, age, teaching experience and discipline were found to be moderating factors. This research provides further verification of the effectiveness of the UTAUT2 Model in the higher education context and the field of new technologies implementation. Findings from this study provide beneficial insights for universities, faculties, and academics in policymaking, faculty management, professional development and lecturer instruction concerning mobile technologies.},

	abstract = {Some previous research has illustrated teachers' conceptions and responsibilities in student-centered classes for assisting potent implementation of novel pedagogies. On the other hand, mobile learning has been widely adopted in education in the past decades, and a great deal of previous research has revealed the effects of mobile learning on students' learning. However, few studies have probed teachers' conceptions of mobile technology-integrated instruction. In this study, a total of 25 elementary school teachers in Taiwan were interviewed, and the phenomenographic method was adopted to explore the teachers' conceptions of mobile learning. As a result of the data analysis, seven qualitatively and hierarchically different categories (7-T) of mobile learning were revealed, namely a “Tool,” “Travel,” “Timeliness/Tutor,” a “Toy,” “Tracking,” “Teamwork,” and a “Tutee.” These hierarchical categories represent a spectrum ranging from “teacher-centered” to “student/teacher interaction,” and “student-centered” instructional strategies. Among the 7 categories, 4 (i.e., Toy, Tracking, Teamwork, and Tutee) are considered as student-centered instructional strategies, and the tracking category had the maximum frequency of teachers’ main conceptions of mobile learning. Thus, mobile technology offers opportunities to facilitate student-centered learning. The results provide educators and teachers with deep comprehension of advanced technology-enhanced learning for designing student-centered learning activities.},

However, scholars have not covered certain aspects of familiar contexts in their reviews, such as which learning/instructional methodologies support learning in familiar contexts or what the affordances of familiar contexts are for language learning. To address this gap, the authors in this study reviewed research articles related to MALL in familiar, authentic environments published in the past 10 years. The reviewed articles were from journals published in the Social Science Citation Index between 2009 and 2018. The main aim of this study was to review the published articles to understand (1) pedagogical approaches, (2) data collection, (3) locations, (4) affordances of authentic environments and (5) issues in MALL research. The results revealed that the most frequent items in reviewed articles were task-based learning and communicative language teaching (pedagogical approaches); questionnaires, pretest and posttests and interviews (data collection); the local community and campus (locations); daily encounters, language learning and cognitive load (affordances of authentic environments); and small sample sizes and short-term interventions (issues in MALL research). Based on the results, the authors in this study made several suggestions and provided implications for educators and researchers in the field about MALL in familiar, authentic environments.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.02342},
	abstract = {Both reviews and user-item interactions (i.e., rating scores) have been widely adopted for user rating prediction. However, these existing techniques mainly extract the latent representations for users and items in an independent and static manner. That is, a single static feature vector is derived to encode her preference without considering the particular characteristics of each candidate item. We argue that this static encoding scheme is difficult to fully capture the users' preference. In this paper, we propose a novel context-aware user-item representation learning model for rating prediction, named CARL. Namely, CARL derives a joint representation for a given user-item pair based on their individual latent features and latent feature interactions. Then, CARL adopts Factorization Machines to further model higher-order feature interactions on the basis of the user-item pair for rating prediction. Specifically, two separate learning components are devised in CARL to exploit review data and interaction data respectively: review-based feature learning and interaction-based feature learning. In review-based learning component, with convolution operations and attention mechanism, the relevant features for a user-item pair are extracted by jointly considering their corresponding reviews. However, these features are only review-driven and may not be comprehensive. Hence, interaction-based learning component further extracts complementary features from interaction data alone, also on the basis of user-item pairs. The final rating score is then derived with a dynamic linear fusion mechanism. Experiments on five real-world datasets show that CARL achieves significantly better rating prediction accuracy than existing state-of-the-art alternatives. Also, with attention mechanism, we show that the relevant information in reviews can be highlighted to interpret the rating prediction.},

	abstract = {With wide use of cloud computing technologies, microblog is used more widely for services providing more personal communities by user information sharing, dissemination and acquisition. In Microblog environment, hashtag is used to find messages with a specific theme or content, which can greatly facilitate information diffusion, microblog searching, event detection and topic analysis, etc. Recommending relevant hashtags to users in the cloud is challenging, because hashtags are created at tremendous speed alongside microblogs, and scattered in micro-blogging systems without a systematic organization. In this paper, a personalized hashtag recommendation approach is proposed according to the latent topical information in microblogs. With users represented by user-topics distribution, the proposed approach finds top-k similar users, then computes all hashtags’ frequencies appeared in these users, and finally the most relevant hashtags are recommended to user. In order to excavate latent topical information, a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)-based topic model is also proposed, named Hashtag-LDA, which can greatly enhance the influence of hashtags on latent topics’ generation by jointly modeling hashtags and words in microblogs. Hashtag-LDA can not only find meaningful latent topics, but also find global hashtags and the relationships between topics and hashtags. The experimental results on real Twitter dataset show that the proposed recommendation approach outperforms the related methods and Hashtag-LDA is effective.},

	abstract = {Blog search engines and general search engines automatically crawl web pages from the Internet and produce search results for users. One difference between the two is that blog search engines focus on posts and ignore the rest of the pages. Obviously, the pages indexed by the general search engine are always greater than the posts. This feature allows bloggers to focus only on the posts they are interested in, rather than other types of pages. The other difference is that posts involve more time-related issues compared to general pages. For the general pages, the general search engine often can only show the last update time. However, for the post, the blog search engine can display various possible times. For some often updated posts, the time factor can help bloggers find information more efficiently. In this paper, we first use some well-known semantic analysis models to analyze the performance of the blog search. Next, we consider the time relationship between posts to further improve its performance. Finally, we provide some experiments to simulate various possible scenarios to confirm the effectiveness of this relationship. The contributions of this paper are twofold. One is that we build a high-performance system that considers the importance of blog topics at different times. The other is that we consider the time relationship between posts, which can rank the relevant blog topics based on the popularity of the posts.},
