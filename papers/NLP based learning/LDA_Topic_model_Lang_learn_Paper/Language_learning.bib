	abstract = {This study evaluated the effectiveness of a mobile application (app) designed within the framework of cognitive apprenticeship, in order to facilitate students struggling with learning English as a foreign language (EFL). The participants were ten seventh-graders, who were performing significantly below grade level in their EFL classroom. The research questions targeted changes in learning outcomes with the aid of the app, attitudes the participants had towards the learning experience, and student perceptions regarding the design of the app. Data were collected by interviews, observation, surveys, and exams. The results indicated use of the app enhanced EFL learning. Not only did the app provide a feasible path for the students moving from individual learning to cooperative learning, it also bolstered their confidence in learning, ultimately promoting positive attitudes toward EFL learning. Finally, the design of the app was confirmed as an effective tool for mobile instruction, yet student perceptions of the interface design indicated a need for modification to be more adaptive. The findings confirm the legitimacy of the app's instructional design and may provide evidence-based learning materials to scaffold EFL learning.},

	abstract = {At present, hardly any younger person can imagine life without mobile technologies. They use them on a daily basis, including in language learning. Such learning supported with mobile devices is called mobile learning, which seems beneficial especially thanks to the unique features of mobile applications (e.g., interactivity, ubiquity, and portability) and teachers’ encouragement and feedback. The purpose of this review study is to explore original, peer-reviewed English studies from 2015 to April 2019 and to determine whether mobile applications used in the learning of English as a foreign language are beneficial and/or effective. The methods are based on a literature review of available sources found on the research topic in two acknowledged databases: Web of Science and Scopus. Altogether, 16 original journal studies on the research topic were detected. The results reveal that mobile learning is becoming a salient feature of education as it is a great opportunity for foreign language learning. Its key benefits are as follows: the enhancement of the learner’s cognitive capacity, the learner’s motivation to study in both formal and informal settings, the learner’s autonomy and confidence, as well as the promotion of personalized learning, helping low-achieving students to reach their study goals. Although mobile learning seems to be effective overall, it is desirable to design, plan and implement it with caution, according to students’ needs, and to deliver multiple language skills in authentic learning environments.},

	abstract = {More than 300 million people use the gamified mobile-assisted language learning (MALL) application (app) Duolingo. The challenging tasks, reward incentives, systematic levels, and the ranking of users according to their achievements are just some of the elements that demonstrate strong gamification elements within this popular language learning application. This application’s pervasive reach, flexible functionality, and freemium business model has brought significant attention to gamification in MALL. The present systematic review aims to summarize different methods, frameworks, settings, and research samples used to assess Duolingo’s design and impact on various learning outcomes. We carried out a complete database search for articles focused on the issues of design, application, and pedagogies in the use of Duolingo. Three hundred and sixty-seven records were initially found, and 35 of those were selected for final inclusion based on language choice, theoretical frameworks, design, sampling, data collection, and analyses (see Appendix 1 for full list). The results indicated that the majority of research from 2012-2020 was design-focused, quantitative in nature, and used non-probability sampling methods. The focus on app design marks an emphasis on the creation of tools rather than the process and outcomes of language learning from using these tools. Additional results revealed preferences for performance-based research questions, for English as language of choice in research, and for the USA as the most prominent context for Duolingo research studies. Furthermore, our review highlights research gaps specific to Duolingo, yet generalizable to other MALL applications. The results are useful to researchers seeking to assess, evaluate, and understand MALL, gamification, and Duolingo as well as to practitioners interested in utilizing MALL in formal and informal learning environments.},

	abstract = {Every generation of students has different characteristics that reflect the conditions of the time period they were growing in. It is important for educators from all fields of study, especially English language teachers, to understand the generational differences and the learning preferences of students in order to create productive learning environments. In today’s technology driven era, students have different learning needs in comparison with their predecessors. To enhance language learning in the new generation, it is recommended to use mobile technology in class. Mobile devices and applications offer a wide range of activities that support language learning. The aim of this study was to discover if the students using mobile devices in the class got higher scores in tests than the students using traditional methods. The methods included pre- and post-tests, as well as a questionnaire survey. The results of this study reveal that the use of a mobile application had a positive effect on students’ achievement results as far as the vocabulary learning was concerned. The students using the app seemed to retain more words than the students in the control group. Furthermore, the results of the questionnaire showed that using the app was more enjoyable for students than the traditional teaching methods. In addition, it contributed to collaborative learning. However, the results also indicate that being a Generation Z student does not make him/her automatically interested in using mobile applications in the process of language acquisition. Considering the small number of participants, further studies are planned to confirm the results from the current preliminary study.},

The main findings from this review demonstrate the popularity of mobile-based AR for supporting vocabulary (23.9\%), reading (12.7\%), speaking (9.9\%) writing (8.5\%) or generic language skills (9.9\%). Our findings also uncovered areas that merit future attention in the application of AR in language learning – for instance learning theories were not often considered in the implementation of AR.

	abstract = {The widespread use of mobile devices and the wider coverage of wireless networks offer the educational sectors various alternatives in enhancing learning and teaching. Mobile assisted language learning (MALL) emerges from this trend and draws traction from relevant stakeholders. While much research has been done on the application of mobile technologies in promoting language learning, and the educational practices that foster that learning approach, relatively little empirical evidence has been given to understand the acceptance and use of MALL by higher education learners, particularly in the context of a developing country. This study sought to fill this gap by applying the modified version of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). Survey data from 293 higher education learners from Vietnam were analyzed by the Rasch-based path model. Results indicated the important roles of attitude and performance expectancy in predicting learners' behavior intention and their usage of MALL. Facilitating condition was found to have no direct effect on learners' usage of MALL, representing a departure from the literature. The findings offered implications regarding the use of the UTAUT as an appropriate model for examining MALL acceptance, the improvement of technical and organizational supports, as well as the need for more empirical studies on the instructional approaches that foster the use of MALL, particularly in the context of a developing country like Vietnam.},

In this special issue, we interrogated the promise and unexamined expectations of mobile learning, the theories and ideas developing around it, and the devices that afford it. The articles introduce mobile and wearable technologies as key components of empirical research and demonstrate ways that learning conducted with such devices (1) affects the process and products of learning via interactions with other psychological constructs; (2) affords new opportunities to directly influence learning process or outcomes; and (3) provides opportunities to collect previously unobtainable data that improve understanding and modeling of the learning process. In this introduction, we overview the emergence of mobile learning theory and its contemporary conceptualization. Then we highlight ways that mobile technologies can be used to enhance learning processes and an understanding of them. All special issue contributors conceptualize and align their work with both psychological theories of learning and instruction as well as emerging theories of mobile learning. The commentary authors appraise mobile learning research critically and analytically, and recommend ways mobile learning theory might build upon research methodology and knowledge grounded empirically in psychological and sociocultural theories of learning. Overall, we believe this special issue achieved our goal to produce a balanced consideration that highlights the advancements in learning and learning theory mobile devices might afford, and to temper any premature enthusiasm about these potential benefits.},

The results show that mobile technology and pedagogical innovation are not challenging for teachers. Instead, psychological anxiety, extended pedagogical roles, and learning flexibility are the challenging issues.

	abstract = {Today’s world demands more efficient learning models that allow students to play a more active role in their education. Technology is having an impact on how instruction is delivered and how information is found and share. Until very recently, the educational models encouraged memorization as an essential learning skill. These days, technologies have changed the educational model and access to information. Knowledge is available online, mostly free, and easily accessible. Reading, sharing, listening and, doing are currently necessary skills for education. Mobile devices have become a complete set of applications, support, and help for educational organizations. By conducting an analysis of the behavior and use of mobile devices on current students, efficient educational applications can be developed. Although there are several initiatives for the use of mobile learning in education, there are also issues linked to this technology that must be addressed. In this work, we present the results of a literature review of mobile learning; the findings described are the result of the analysis of several articles obtained in three scientific repositories. This work also lists certain issues that, if properly addressed, can avoid possible complications to the implementation of this technology in education.},

This scoping review investigates the current practices of digital game-based language learning to support English language learning, in terms of participants’ characteristics, methodological features, gaming characteristics, and an association between game availability and gaming characteristics. Our results indicate: (1) vocabulary is the most dominant practiced language skills; (2) methods employed were primarily quantitative with researcher-designed tests; (3) commercial games contain the most elements of a good game; (4) use of good gaming elements is inconsistent among digital games. We provide strategies for educational researchers to improve their rigor in research, along with explicit criteria that digital game designers can apply toward language-learning game development. As educational technology continues to transform language learning, we emphasize the need for continued research and development that investigates how gaming elements in mobile learning environments may improve language-learning outcomes.},

	abstract = {With the proliferation of technology and the Internet, the way education is delivered has undergone a rapid change in different educational settings. Whilst a large amount of research has investigated the implementation of mobile technologies in education, there is still a paucity of research from a teaching perspective across disciplines within higher education. For this reason, this study investigated the acceptance, preparedness and adoption of mobile technologies by academic faculties within higher education, using the context of China. Underpinned by the extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) Model, a large-scale quantitative survey investigated the factors affecting academics’ behavioural intentions and use for mobile technologies, and variations between different demographic groups. Findings suggested that the most significant factors affecting academics’ behavioural intention and behaviours of use were their performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation and habit. Behavioural intention also affected how the faculty staff used their mobile technologies. Moreover, gender, age, teaching experience and discipline were found to be moderating factors. This research provides further verification of the effectiveness of the UTAUT2 Model in the higher education context and the field of new technologies implementation. Findings from this study provide beneficial insights for universities, faculties, and academics in policymaking, faculty management, professional development and lecturer instruction concerning mobile technologies.},

On the other hand, mobile learning has been widely adopted in education in the past decades, and a great deal of previous research has revealed the effects of mobile learning on students' learning. However, few studies have probed teachers' conceptions of mobile technology-integrated instruction. In this study, a total of 25 elementary school teachers in Taiwan were interviewed, and the phenomenographic method was adopted to explore the teachers' conceptions of mobile learning. As a result of the data analysis, seven qualitatively and hierarchically different categories (7-T) of mobile learning were revealed, namely a “Tool,” “Travel,” “Timeliness/Tutor,” a “Toy,” “Tracking,” “Teamwork,” and a “Tutee.” These hierarchical categories represent a spectrum ranging from “teacher-centered” to “student/teacher interaction,” and “student-centered” instructional strategies. Among the 7 categories, 4 (i.e., Toy, Tracking, Teamwork, and Tutee) are considered as student-centered instructional strategies, and the tracking category had the maximum frequency of teachers’ main conceptions of mobile learning. Thus, mobile technology offers opportunities to facilitate student-centered learning. The results provide educators and teachers with deep comprehension of advanced technology-enhanced learning for designing student-centered learning activities.},

However, scholars have not covered certain aspects of familiar contexts in their reviews, such as which learning/instructional methodologies support learning in familiar contexts or what the affordances of familiar contexts are for language learning. To address this gap, the authors in this study reviewed research articles related to MALL in familiar, authentic environments published in the past 10 years. The reviewed articles were from journals published in the Social Science Citation Index between 2009 and 2018. The main aim of this study was to review the published articles to understand (1) pedagogical approaches, (2) data collection, (3) locations, (4) affordances of authentic environments and (5) issues in MALL research. The results revealed that the most frequent items in reviewed articles were task-based learning and communicative language teaching (pedagogical approaches); questionnaires, pretest and posttests and interviews (data collection); the local community and campus (locations); daily encounters, language learning and cognitive load (affordances of authentic environments); and small sample sizes and short-term interventions (issues in MALL research). Based on the results, the authors in this study made several suggestions and provided implications for educators and researchers in the field about MALL in familiar, authentic environments.},

However, the review of mobile learning in ESP is scarce, despite its importance in sustaining education. Thus, this review systematically identifies the trends of mobile learning concerning ESP. Using three databases, namely Web of Science (WoS), Scopus, and Educational Resources Information Centre (ERIC), 28 articles were extracted out of 139, from 2012 to 2021, with exclusion and inclusion criteria taken into consideration. First, the significant findings portrayed that mobile apps are the most commonly used means of mobile learning. Second, vocabulary and language competency is more emphasised in mobile learning for ESP. Third, mobile learning in ESP mostly dominated the business field of studies. These three findings implied that there are still gaps in research on mobile learning and ESP. Generally, this review is valuable for practitioners to know which mobile learning tool is ready to be used and in identifying gaps for research in mobile learning and ESP, to sustain education for the future.},

A total of 201 participants enrolled in an EFL teacher education department at a major state university participated in the study and completed the "Mobile Learning Perception Scale." Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics (means and frequencies, and percentage) and inferential statistics (MANOVA and regression analysis). Findings revealed that overall the participants had high levels of perceptions about MALL, and that gender, grade level and GPA differences moderated the effects of the measured constructs on their perceptions of MALL. All the interviewees expressed their positive attitudes towards using mobile devices in language instruction. The results of multivariate tests indicated a significant main effect for their gender and their perceptions, as well as an interaction effect between gender and GPA. Findings also demonstrated that GPA and gender were the strongest predictors of participants' perceptions about MALL.},

The third group received the same treatment as the second but, as an extension, was allowed to take the mobile application home for a fortnight. A pre- and a posttest were conducted to measure the individual change in mastery of a set of targeted English words. The results showed that the group which took the mobile phone home improved the most. However, when the additional learning time, spent apart from school, of this third group was controlled for, the superior performance of the group disappeared. The results indicate that students are motivated to use the application in their spare time and that this benefits their learning. The conclusion is that formal school learning can be augmented by learning in an informal context, away from school.},

In line with these trends, this study aims to investigate Slovak EFL learners’ attitudes and perceptions of English language learning apps (ELLA) regarding practicing and learning English. Furthermore, the differences in the perception of ELLA between the male and female research participants are also analysed. The target population totalled 158 Slovak university EFL learners, 48 males and 110 females, who were required to display their level of agreement to statements by responding to a 5-point Likert scale questionnaire. The instrument consisted of 30 statements altogether, involving items on apps’ usage and apps’ perception. The calculated means indicate that the participants’ attitudes and perceptions of ELLA range between being neutral and positive, and that EFL learners tend to practice language systems and skills to varying degrees. Moreover, 30 independent-sample t-tests, which were run in order to determine the differences between the male and female attitudes and perceptions, reveal that 50\% of statements on apps’ usage and apps’ perception differ significantly, demonstrating considerable differences between the two sexes. The achieved results seem to contribute to the existing research on the use of smartphones and ELLA in the context of EFL learning by casting more light on mobile language learning, an area that merits further scientific exploration.},

	abstract = {At present, there is an increasing trend in the shift from the use of traditional technologies such as a desktop computer towards the use of mobile technologies such as a mobile phone. Nearly all students nowadays own a mobile device and about half of them own more than one. Therefore, students are well equipped for mobile learning. The purpose of this article is to firstly explore the use of mobile learning and its use in English language teaching. Secondly, on the basis of students’ needs, the authors aim to exploit and describe a mobile application aimed at learning English vocabulary and phrases among students of Management of Tourism in their third year of study. Finally, on the basis of the results from the final tests, they attempt to analyze and evaluate to what extent the mobile application is effective in their learning of English vocabulary and phrases. The results show that the use of mobile app contributes to the improvement of students’ learning, in this case of English vocabulary and phrases relevant to their needs. In addition, the findings also confirm that professional and careful guidance of learning via a mobile app can lead to independent learning, i.e. students’ self-study.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.02342},
	abstract = {Both reviews and user-item interactions (i.e., rating scores) have been widely adopted for user rating prediction. However, these existing techniques mainly extract the latent representations for users and items in an independent and static manner. That is, a single static feature vector is derived to encode her preference without considering the particular characteristics of each candidate item. We argue that this static encoding scheme is difficult to fully capture the users' preference. In this paper, we propose a novel context-aware user-item representation learning model for rating prediction, named CARL. Namely, CARL derives a joint representation for a given user-item pair based on their individual latent features and latent feature interactions. Then, CARL adopts Factorization Machines to further model higher-order feature interactions on the basis of the user-item pair for rating prediction. Specifically, two separate learning components are devised in CARL to exploit review data and interaction data respectively: review-based feature learning and interaction-based feature learning. In review-based learning component, with convolution operations and attention mechanism, the relevant features for a user-item pair are extracted by jointly considering their corresponding reviews. However, these features are only review-driven and may not be comprehensive. Hence, interaction-based learning component further extracts complementary features from interaction data alone, also on the basis of user-item pairs. The final rating score is then derived with a dynamic linear fusion mechanism. Experiments on five real-world datasets show that CARL achieves significantly better rating prediction accuracy than existing state-of-the-art alternatives. Also, with attention mechanism, we show that the relevant information in reviews can be highlighted to interpret the rating prediction.},

	abstract = {With wide use of cloud computing technologies, microblog is used more widely for services providing more personal communities by user information sharing, dissemination and acquisition. In Microblog environment, hashtag is used to find messages with a specific theme or content, which can greatly facilitate information diffusion, microblog searching, event detection and topic analysis, etc. Recommending relevant hashtags to users in the cloud is challenging, because hashtags are created at tremendous speed alongside microblogs, and scattered in micro-blogging systems without a systematic organization. In this paper, a personalized hashtag recommendation approach is proposed according to the latent topical information in microblogs. With users represented by user-topics distribution, the proposed approach finds top-k similar users, then computes all hashtags’ frequencies appeared in these users, and finally the most relevant hashtags are recommended to user. In order to excavate latent topical information, a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)-based topic model is also proposed, named Hashtag-LDA, which can greatly enhance the influence of hashtags on latent topics’ generation by jointly modeling hashtags and words in microblogs. Hashtag-LDA can not only find meaningful latent topics, but also find global hashtags and the relationships between topics and hashtags. The experimental results on real Twitter dataset show that the proposed recommendation approach outperforms the related methods and Hashtag-LDA is effective.},

Such an abundance leads to an interesting opportunity: if a student does not like how a primary textbook presents a particular topic s/he can always access its alternative (e.g. more detailed or advanced) presentation elsewhere. Modern e-learning environments could better support access to different versions of instructional material by generating intelligent links between the textbooks sections that present similar topics and concepts. This paper reports an attempt to investigate the problem of fine-grained intelligent linking of online textbooks based on the probabilistic topic modeling technology. Using collections of textbooks in two domains (Elementary Algebra and Information Retrieval), we have demonstrated that intelligent linking based on probabilistic topic models produces a much better modeling quality than traditional term-based approaches.},

Numerous statistical, linguistic, rule-based, and position-based text summarization approaches have been explored for different rich-resourced languages. For under-resourced languages such as Hindi, automatic text summarization is a challenging task and still an unsolved problem. Another issue with such languages is the unavailability of corpus and the inadequacy of the processing tools. In this paper, we proposed an extractive lexical knowledge-rich topic modeling text summarization approach for Hindi novels and stories in which we implemented four independent variants using different sentence weighting schemes. We prepared a corpus of Hindi Novels and stories since the absence of a corpus. We used a smoothing technique for edifying and variety summaries followed by evaluating the efficacy of generated summaries against three metrics (gist diversity, retention ratio, and ROUGE score). The results manifest that the proposed model produces abridge, articulate and coherent summaries. To investigate the performance of the proposed model, we simulate the experiments on the English dataset as well. Further, we compare our models with the baselines and traditional topic modeling approach, where we show that the proposed model has confessed optimal results.},

In this study, we apply an unsupervised machine learning approach to discover sentiment polarity not only at the document level but also at the word level. The proposed topic document sentence (TDS) model is based on joint sentiment topic (JST) and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling techniques. The IMDB dataset, comprising user reviews, was used for data analysis. First, we applied the LDA model to discover topics from the reviews; then, the TDS model was implemented to identify the polarity of the sentiment from topic to document, and from document to word levels. The LDAvis tool was used for data visualization. The experimental results show that the analysis not only obtained good topic partitioning results, but also achieved high sentiment analysis accuracy in document- and word-level sentiment classifications.},

	abstract = {Blog search engines and general search engines automatically crawl web pages from the Internet and produce search results for users. One difference between the two is that blog search engines focus on posts and ignore the rest of the pages. Obviously, the pages indexed by the general search engine are always greater than the posts. This feature allows bloggers to focus only on the posts they are interested in, rather than other types of pages. The other difference is that posts involve more time-related issues compared to general pages. For the general pages, the general search engine often can only show the last update time. However, for the post, the blog search engine can display various possible times. For some often updated posts, the time factor can help bloggers find information more efficiently. In this paper, we first use some well-known semantic analysis models to analyze the performance of the blog search. Next, we consider the time relationship between posts to further improve its performance. Finally, we provide some experiments to simulate various possible scenarios to confirm the effectiveness of this relationship. The contributions of this paper are twofold. One is that we build a high-performance system that considers the importance of blog topics at different times. The other is that we consider the time relationship between posts, which can rank the relevant blog topics based on the popularity of the posts.},

So the significance of extracting knowledge from these data is invaluable for various sectors.

However, similar techniques can be used to evaluate literary work, comprehend the underlying social network, and obtain or validate literary work. This project is about analyzing the book's characters and predicting their characteristics and relationships with one another. A lot of human effort is expended during the adaptation of a novel/book in any form, which is inconvenient and undesirable. Furthermore, the human brain has a tendency to overlook a number of minor details about the events/characters in the book. The scenario described above can frequently result in inaccuracies in the adaptation's plot. As a result, the project is an innovation that aims to aid in the easy and accurate adaptation of a book, making the process much simpler and precise. Machine learning (supervised and unattended) and lexical approaches include the current sentiment analysis techniques. The model's goal is to scan the massive amounts of text in the book.

	abstract = {Social networks play a key role in providing a new approach to collecting information regarding mobility and transportation services. To study this information, sentiment analysis can make decent observations to support intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) in examining traffic control and management systems. However, sentiment analysis faces technical challenges: extracting meaningful information from social network platforms, and the transformation of extracted data into valuable information. In addition, accurate topic modeling and document representation are other challenging tasks in sentiment analysis. We propose an ontology and latent Dirichlet allocation (OLDA)-based topic modeling and word embedding approach for sentiment classification. The proposed system retrieves transportation content from social networks, removes irrelevant content to extract meaningful information, and generates topics and features from extracted data using OLDA. It also represents documents using word embedding techniques, and then employs lexicon-based approaches to enhance the accuracy of the word embedding model. The proposed ontology and the intelligent model are developed using Web Ontology Language and Java, respectively. Machine learning classifiers are used to evaluate the proposed word embedding system. The method achieves accuracy of 93\%, which shows that the proposed approach is effective for sentiment classification.},

Researchers have published many articles in the field of topic modeling and applied in various fields such as software engineering, political science, medical and linguistic science, etc. There are various methods for topic modelling; Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is one of the most popular in this field. Researchers have proposed various models based on the LDA in topic modeling. According to previous work, this paper will be very useful and valuable for introducing LDA approaches in topic modeling. In this paper, we investigated highly scholarly articles (between 2003 to 2016) related to topic modeling based on LDA to discover the research development, current trends and intellectual structure of topic modeling. In addition, we summarize challenges and introduce famous tools and datasets in topic modeling based on LDA.},

Moreover in medical applications, information grows tremendously and hence they must be stored using a suitable storage structure so that it is possible to retrieve them faster from the text corpus in which the medical information is stored. The existing methods for storage and retrieval do not focus on classified organization. However, classified data storage will facilitate fast retrieval. Therefore, a new Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) based topic modeling approach is proposed in this paper which uses temporal rules for effective manipulation of stored data. Therefore, a temporal rule based classification algorithm is proposed in this work by combining Naïve Bayes Classifier with LDA and temporal rules to store the data more efficiently and it helps to retrieve the documents faster. From the experiments conducted in this work by storing and retrieving medical data in a corpus, it is proved that the proposed model is more efficient with respect to classification accuracy leading to organized storage and fast retrieval.},

	abstract = {Recent years have seen the rise of subject-themed digital libraries, such as the NSDL pathways and the Digital Library for Earth System Education (DLESE). These libraries often need to manually verify that contributed resources cover topics that ﬁt within the theme of the library. We show that such scope judgments can be automated using a combination of text classiﬁcation techniques and topic modeling. Our models address two signiﬁcant challenges in making scope judgments: only a small number of out-of-scope resources are typically available, and the topic distinctions required for digital libraries are much more subtle than classic text classiﬁcation problems. To meet these challenges, our models combine support vector machine learners optimized to diﬀerent performance metrics and semantic topics induced by unsupervised statistical topic models. Our best model is able to distinguish resources that belong in DLESE from resources that don’t with an accuracy of around 70\%. We see these models as the ﬁrst steps towards increasing the scalability of digital libraries and dramatically reducing the workload required to maintain them.},

	abstract = {The recent outbreak of novel Coronavirus disease or COVID-19 is declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The availability of social media platforms has played a vital role in providing and obtaining information about any ongoing event. However, consuming a vast amount of online textual data to predict an event's trends can be troublesome. To our knowledge, no study analyzes the online news articles and the disease data about coronavirus disease. Therefore, we propose an LDA-based topic model, called PAN-LDA (Pandemic-Latent Dirichlet allocation), that incorporates the COVID-19 cases data and news articles into common LDA to obtain a new set of features. The generated features are introduced as additional features to Machine learning(ML) algorithms to improve the forecasting of time series data. Furthermore, we are employing collapsed Gibbs sampling (CGS) as the underlying technique for parameter inference. The results from experiments suggest that the obtained features from PAN-LDA generate more identifiable topics and empirically add value to the outcome.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is still raging. Similar to other RNA viruses, SARS-COV-2 is constantly mutating, which leads to the production of many infectious and lethal strains. For instance, the omicron variant detected in November 2021 became the leading strain of infection in many countries around the world and sparked an intense public debate on social media. The aim of this study is to explore the Chinese public’s perception of the omicron variants on social media. A total of 121,632 points of data relating to omicron on Sina Weibo from 0:00 27 November 2021 to 23:59:59 30 March 2022 (Beijing time) were collected and analyzed with LDA-based topic modeling and DLUT-Emotion ontology-based sentiment analysis. The results indicate that (1) the public discussion of omicron is based on five topics, including omicron’s impact on the economy, the omicron infection situation in other countries/regions, the omicron infection situation in China, omicron and vaccines and pandemic prevention and control for omicron. (2) From the 3 sentiment orientations of 121,632 valid Weibo posts, 49,402 posts were judged as positive emotions, accounting for approximately 40.6\%; 47,667 were negative emotions, accounting for nearly 39.2\%; and 24,563 were neutral emotions, accounting for about 20.2\%. (3) The result of the analysis of the temporal trend of the seven categories of emotion attribution showed that fear kept decreasing, whereas good kept increasing. This study provides more insights into public perceptions of and attitudes toward emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. The results of this study may provide further recommendations for the Chinese government, public health authorities, and the media to promote knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 variant pandemic-resistant messages.},
