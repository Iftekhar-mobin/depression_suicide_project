Using Correlational Topic Modeling for Automated Topic Identification in Intelligent Tutoring Systems,"Stefan Slater, R. Baker, M. Almeda, Alex J. Bowers, N. Heffernan",Fully automated approaches that rely on the covariance of correctness on items can lead to effective skill-item mappings.,2017,"Student knowledge modeling is an important part of modern personalized learning systems, but typically relies upon valid models of the structure of the content and skill in a domain. These models are often developed through expert tagging of skills to items. However, content creators in crowdsourced personalized learning systems often lack the time (and sometimes the domain knowledge) to tag skills themselves. Fully automated approaches that rely on the covariance of correctness on items can lead to effective skill-item mappings, but the resultant mappings are often difficult to interpret. In this paper we propose an alternate approach to automatically labeling skills in a crowdsourced personalized learning system using correlated topic modeling, a natural language processing approach, to analyze the linguistic content of mathematics problems. We find a range of potentially meaningful and useful topics within the context of the ASSISTments system for mathematics problem-solving.","• Correlated topic modeling is an effective approach for automatically labeling skills in a crowdsourced personalized learning system.

Topic Predictions and Optimized Recommendation Mechanism Based on Integrated Topic Modeling and Deep Neural Networks in Crowdfunding Platforms,"Wafa Shafqat, Y. Byun",The proposed model can play a substantial role in a better understanding of crowdfunding comments.,2019,"The accelerated growth rate of internet users and its applications, primarily e-business, has accustomed people to write their comments and reviews about the product they received. These reviews are remarkably competent to shape customers' decisions. However, in crowdfunding, where investors finance innovative ideas in exchange for some rewards or products, the comments of investors are often ignored. These comments can play a markedly significant role in helping crowdfunding platforms to battle against the bitter challenge of fraudulent activities. We take advantage of the language modeling techniques and aim to merge them with neural networks to identify some hidden discussion patterns in the comments. Our objective is to design a language modeling based neural network architecture, where Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is used to predict discussion trends, i.e., either towards scam or non-scam. LSTM layers are fed with latent topic distribution learned from the pre-trained Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model. In order to optimize the recommendations, we used Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) as a baseline algorithm. This module helps investors find secure projects to invest in (with the highest chances of delivery) within their preferred categories. We used prediction accuracy, an optimal number of identified topics, and the number of epochs, as metrics of performance evaluation for the proposed approach. We compared our results with simple Neural Networks (NNs) and NN-LDA based on these performance metrics. The strengths of both integrated models suggest that the proposed model can play a substantial role in a better understanding of crowdfunding comments.","• We proposed a language modeling based neural network architecture, where Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is used to predict discussion trends, i.e., either towards scam or non-scam.

Topic Model Methods for Automatically Identifying Out-of-Scope Resources,"Steven Bethard, S. Ghosh, James H. Martin, T. Sumner",The topic distinctions required for digital libraries are much more subtle than classic text classification problems.,2009,"Recent years have seen the rise of subject-themed digital libraries, such as the NSDL pathways and the Digital Library for Earth System Education (DLESE). These libraries often need to manually verify that contributed resources cover topics that fit within the theme of the library. We show that such scope judgments can be automated using a combination of text classification techniques and topic modeling. Our models address two significant challenges in making scope judgments: only a small number of out-of-scope resources are typically available, and the topic distinctions required for digital libraries are much more subtle than classic text classification problems. To meet these challenges, our models combine support vector machine learners optimized to different performance metrics and semantic topics induced by unsupervised statistical topic models. Our best model is able to distinguish resources that belong in DLESE from resources that don't with an accuracy of around 70%. We see these models as the first steps towards increasing the scalability of digital libraries and dramatically reducing the workload required to maintain them.","• Automated scope judgments for digital libraries can be made using a combination of text classification techniques and topic modeling.

When One Textbook Is Not Enough: Linking Multiple Textbooks Using Probabilistic Topic Models,"Julio Guerra, Sergey Sosnovsky, Peter Brusilovsky",Modern e-learning environments could better support access to different versions of instructional material by generating intelligent links between the textbooks sections that present similar topics and concepts.,2013,"The Web-revolution in publishing and reading is rapidly increasing the volume of online textbooks. Nowadays, for most of the subjects, a selection of online textbooks is available.

PAN-LDA: A latent Dirichlet allocation based novel feature extraction model for COVID-19 data using machine learning,"Aakansha Gupta, R. Katarya",The obtained features from PAN-LDA generate more identifiable topics and empirically add value to the outcome.,2021,"The recent outbreak of novel Coronavirus disease or COVID-19 is declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The availability of social media platforms has played a vital role in providing and obtaining information about any ongoing event. However, consuming a vast amount of online textual data to predict an event's trends can be troublesome. To our knowledge, no study analyzes the online news articles and the disease data about coronavirus disease. Therefore, we propose an LDA-based topic model, called PAN-LDA (Pandemic-Latent Dirichlet allocation), that incorporates the COVID-19 cases data and news articles into common LDA to obtain a new set of features. The generated features are introduced as additional features to Machine learning (ML) algorithms to improve the forecasting of time series data. Furthermore, we are employing collapsed Gibbs sampling (CGS) as the underlying technique for parameter inference. The results from experiments suggest that the obtained features from PAN-LDA generate more identifiable topics and empirically add value to the outcome.","• We proposed an LDA-based topic model, called PAN-LDA, that incorporates COVID-19 cases data and news articles into common LDA to obtain a new set of features.

"Sentiment analysis, opinion mining and topic modelling of epics and novels using machine learning techniques","M KrishnaRajP, D JagadeeshSai",The human brain has a tendency to overlook a number of minor details about the events/characters in the book.,2021,"Sentiment analysis systems can collect and automatically structure unstructured information by collecting public views of services, products, policy, brands, etc. This information is of major value in the fields of marketing analysis, public relations, product reviews, net promoter evaluations, customer feedback and client reviews. Literary works, on the other hand, are less susceptible to computational analysis because there are no immediate commercial incentives. However, similar techniques can be used to evaluate literary work, comprehend the underlying social network, and obtain or validate literary work. This project is about analyzing the book's characters and predicting their characteristics and relationships with one another. A lot of human effort is expended during the adaptation of a novel/book in any form, which is inconvenient and undesirable. Furthermore, the human brain has a tendency to overlook a number of minor details about the events/characters in the book. The scenario described above can frequently result in inaccuracies in the adaptation's plot. As a result, the project is an innovation that aims to aid in the easy and accurate adaptation of a book, making the process much simpler and precise. Machine learning (supervised and unattended) and lexical approaches include the current sentiment analysis techniques. The model's goal is to scan the massive amounts of text in the book.

An extractive text summarization approach using tagged-LDA based topic modeling,"R. Rani, D. K. Lobiyal","The proposed model produces abridge, articulate, and coherent summaries.",2020,"Automatic text summarization is an exertion of contriving the abridged form of a text document covering salient knowledge. Numerous statistical, linguistic, rule-based, and position-based text summarization approaches have been explored for different richresourced languages. For under-resourced languages such as Hindi, automatic text summarization is a challenging task and still an unsolved problem. Another issue with such languages is the unavailability of corpus and the inadequacy of the processing tools. In this paper, we proposed an extractive lexical knowledge-rich topic modeling text summarization approach for Hindi novels and stories in which we implemented four independent variants using different sentence weighting schemes. We prepared a corpus of Hindi Novels and stories since the absence of a corpus. We used a smoothing technique for edifying and variety summaries followed by evaluating the efficacy of generated summaries against three metrics (gist diversity, retention ratio, and ROUGE score). The results manifest that the proposed model produces abridge, articulate and coherent summaries. To investigate the performance of the proposed model, we simulate the experiments on the English dataset as well. Further, we compare our models with the baselines and traditional topic modeling approach, where we show that the proposed model has confessed optimal results.","• A lexical knowledge-rich topic modeling text summarization approach for Hindi novels and stories was proposed.

Structured Topic Models for Language,Hanna M. Wallach,A topic-based language model does better at predicting future words than either a topic model or a trigram language model.,2008,"This thesis introduces new methods for statistically modelling text using topic models. Topic models have seen many successes in recent years, and are used in a variety of applications, including analysis of news articles, topic-based search interfaces and navigation tools for digital libraries. Despite these recent successes, the field of topic modelling is still relatively new and there remains much to be explored. One noticeable absence from most of the previous work on topic modelling is consideration of language and document structure—from low-level structures, including word order and syntax, to higher-level structures, such as relationships between documents. The focus of this thesis is therefore structured topic models—models that combine latent topics with information about document structure, ranging from local sentence structure to inter-document relationships. These models draw on techniques from Bayesian statistics, including hierarchical Dirichlet distributions and processes, Pitman-Yor processes, and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Several methods for estimating the parameters of Dirichlet-multinomial distributions are also compared. The main contribution of this thesis is the introduction of three structured topic models. The first is a topic-based language model. This model captures both word order and latent topics by extending a Bayesian topic model to incorporate n-gram statistics. A bigram version of the new model does better at predicting future words than either a topic model or a trigram language model. It also provides interpretable topics. The second model arises from a Bayesian reinterpretation of a classic generative dependency parsing model. The new model demonstrates that parsing performance can be substantially improved by a careful choice of prior and by sampling hyperparameters. Additionally, the generative nature of the model facilitates the inclusion of latent state variables, which act as specialised part-of-speech tags or “syntactic topics”. The third is a model that captures high-level relationships between documents. This model uses nonparametric Bayesian priors and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to infer topic-based document clusters. The model assigns a higher probability to unseen test documents than either a clustering model without topics or a Bayesian topic model without document clusters. The model can be extended to incorporate author information, resulting in finer-grained clusters and better predictive performance.","• Three structured topic models are introduced: a topic-based language model, a generative dependency parsing model, and a model that captures high-level relationships between documents.

How Readability and Topic Incidence Relate to Performance on Mathematics Story Problems in Computer-Based Curricula,"C. Walkington, Virginia Clinton, Steven Ritter, Mitchell J. Nathan",The readability and topic of story problems were associated with students' tendency to give correct answers and request hints in Cognitive Tutor.,2015,"Solving mathematics story problems requires text comprehension skills. However, previous studies have found few connections between traditional measures of text readability and performance on story problems. We hypothesized that recently developed measures of readability and topic incidence measured by text-mining tools may illuminate associations between text difficulty and problem-solving measures. We used data from 3,216 middle and high school students from 10 schools using the Cognitive Tutor Algebra program; these schools were geographically, socioeconomically, racially, and ethnically diverse. We found that several indicators of the readability and topic of story problems were associated with students’ tendency to give correct answers and request hints in Cognitive Tutor. We further examined the individual skill of writing an algebraic expression from a story scenario, and examined students at the lowest performing schools in the sample only, and found additional associations for these subsets. Key readability and topic categories that were related to problem-solving measures included word difficulty, text length, pronoun use, sentence similarity, and topic familiarity.

Factorization Models for Forecasting Student Performance,"Nguyen Thai-Nghe, Tomáš Horváth, L. Schmidt-Thieme",A reliable model for predicting student performance could save millions of hours of students' time and effort in learning algebra.,2011,"Predicting student performance, one of the tasks in educational data mining, has been taken into account recently [Toscher and Jahrer 2010; Yu et al. 2010; Cetintas et al. 2010; Thai-Nghe et al. 2011]. It was selected as a challenge task for the KDD Cup 2010 [Koedinger et al. 2010]. Concretely, predicting student performance is the task where we would like to know how the students learn (e.g. generally or narrowly), how quickly or slowly they adapt to new problems or if it is possible to infer the knowledge requirements to solve the problems directly from student performance data [Corbett and Anderson 1995; Feng et al. 2009], and eventually, we would like to know whether the students perform the tasks (exercises) correctly (or with some levels of certainty). As discussed in Cen et al. [2006], an improved model for predicting student performance could save millions of hours of students’ time and effort in learning algebra. In that time, students could move to other specific fields of their study or doing other things they enjoy. From educational data mining point of view, an accurate and reliable model in predicting student performance may replace some current standardized tests, and thus, reducing the pressure, time, as well as effort on “teaching and learning for examinations” [Feng et al. 2009; Thai-Nghe et al. 2011]. To address the problem of predicting student performance, many papers have been published but most of them are based on traditional classification/regression techniques [Cen et al. 2006; Feng et al. 2009; Yu et al. 2010; Pardos and Heffernan 2010]. Many other works can be found in Romero et al. [2010]. Recently, [Thai-Nghe et al. 2010; Toscher and Jahrer 2010; Thai-Nghe et al. 2011] have proposed using recommendation techniques, e.g. matrix factorization, for predicting student performance. The authors have shown that predicting student performance can be considered as rating prediction since the student, task, and performance would become user, item, and rating in recommender systems, respectively. We know that learning and problem-solving are complex cognitive and affective processes that are different to shopping and other e-commerce transactions, however, as discussed in Thai-Nghe et al. [2011], the factorization models in recommender systems are implicitly able to encode latent factors of students and tasks (e.g. “slip” and “guess”), and especially in case where we do not have enough meta data about students and tasks (or even we have not enough background knowledge of the domain), this mapping is a reasonable approach.","• Traditional classification/regression techniques have been used to predict student performance.

Mapping question items to skills with non-negative matrix factorization,M. Desmarais,The NMF technique is highly effective in deriving the Q-matrix.,2012,"Intelligent learning environments need to assess the student skills to tailor course material, provide helpful hints, and in general provide some kind of personalized interaction. To perform this assessment, question items, exercises, and tasks are presented to the student. This assessment relies on a mapping of tasks to skills. However, the process of deciding which skills are involved in a given task is tedious and challenging. Means to automate it are highly desirable, even if only partial automation that provides supportive tools can be achieved. A recent technique based on Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) was shown to offer valuable results, especially due to the fact that the resulting factorization allows a straightforward interpretation in terms of a Q-matrix. We investigate the factors and assumptions under which NMF can effectively derive the underlying high level skills behind assessment results. We demonstrate the use of different techniques to analyze and interpret the output of NMF. We propose a simple model to generate simulated data and to provide lower and upper bounds for quantifying skill effect. Using the simulated data, we show that, under the assumption of independent skills, the NMF technique is highly effective in deriving the Q-matrix. However, the NMF performance degrades under different ratios of variance between subject performance, item difficulty, and skill mastery. The results corroborates conclusions from previous work in that high level skills, corresponding to general topics like World History and Biology, seem to have no substantial effect on test performance, whereas other topics like Mathematics and French do. The analysis and visualization techniques of the NMF output, along with the simulation approach presented in this paper, should be useful for future investigations using NMF for Q-matrix induction from data.","• Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is an effective technique for deriving the underlying high level skills behind assessment results.

The LDA model assumes that the words of each document arise from a mixture of topics, each of which is a distribution over the vocabulary. A limitation of LDA is the inability to model topic correlation even though, for example, a document about genetics is more likely to also be about disease than X-ray astronomy. This limitation stems from the use of the Dirichlet distribution to model the variability among the topic proportions. In this paper we develop the correlated topic model (CTM), where the topic proportions exhibit correlation via the logistic normal distribution [J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 44 (1982) 139--177]. We derive a fast variational inference algorithm for approximate posterior inference in this model, which is complicated by the fact that the logistic normal is not conjugate to the multinomial. We apply the CTM to the articles from Science published from 1990--1999, a data set that comprises 57M words. The CTM gives a better fit of the data than LDA, and we demonstrate its use as an exploratory tool of large document collections.","• The Correlated Topic Model (CTM) is a useful tool for the statistical analysis of document collections and other discrete data.

• CTM is an improvement over the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, as it is able to model topic correlation.

• A fast variational inference algorithm was developed for approximate posterior inference in the CTM model.",
