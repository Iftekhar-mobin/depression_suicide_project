The participants were ten seventh-graders, who were performing significantly below grade level in their EFL classroom. The research questions targeted changes in learning outcomes with the aid of the app, attitudes the participants had towards the learning experience, and student perceptions regarding the design of the app. Data were collected by interviews, observation, surveys, and exams. The results indicated use of the app enhanced EFL learning. Not only did the app provide a feasible path for the students moving from individual learning to cooperative learning, it also bolstered their confidence in learning, ultimately promoting positive attitudes toward EFL learning. Finally, the design of the app was confirmed as an effective tool for mobile instruction, yet student perceptions of the interface design indicated a need for modification to be more adaptive. The findings confirm the legitimacy of the app's instructional design and may provide evidence-based learning materials to scaffold EFL learning.",2019-06-01,2023-07-28 12:52:32,2023-07-28 12:52:32,2023-07-28 12:52:32,208-216,,,95,,Computers in Human Behavior,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,C:\Users\iftek\Zotero\storage\UKRY43HT\S0747563218304977.html,,,APP; English as a foreign language (EFL); Low student performance; Middle school; Mobile learning; Technology integration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They use them on a daily basis, including in language learning. Such learning supported with mobile devices is called mobile learning, which seems beneficial especially thanks to the unique features of mobile applications (e.g., interactivity, ubiquity, and portability) and teachers’ encouragement and feedback. The purpose of this review study is to explore original, peer-reviewed English studies from 2015 to April 2019 and to determine whether mobile applications used in the learning of English as a foreign language are beneficial and/or effective. The methods are based on a literature review of available sources found on the research topic in two acknowledged databases: Web of Science and Scopus. Altogether, 16 original journal studies on the research topic were detected. The results reveal that mobile learning is becoming a salient feature of education as it is a great opportunity for foreign language learning. Its key benefits are as follows: the enhancement of the learner’s cognitive capacity, the learner’s motivation to study in both formal and informal settings, the learner’s autonomy and confidence, as well as the promotion of personalized learning, helping low-achieving students to reach their study goals. Although mobile learning seems to be effective overall, it is desirable to design, plan and implement it with caution, according to students’ needs, and to deliver multiple language skills in authentic learning environments.",2019-09,2023-07-28 12:52:46,2023-07-28 12:52:46,2023-07-28 12:52:46,179,,3,9,,,,,,,,,,en,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/,,,,www.mdpi.com,,Number: 3 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,,C:\Users\iftek\Zotero\storage\G68UJX6T\Kacetl and Klímová - 2019 - Use of Smartphone Applications in English Language.pdf,,,benefits; English learning; mobile apps; mobile learning; use,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The challenging tasks, reward incentives, systematic levels, and the ranking of users according to their achievements are just some of the elements that demonstrate strong gamification elements within this popular language learning application. This application’s pervasive reach, flexible functionality, and freemium business model has brought significant attention to gamification in MALL. The present systematic review aims to summarize different methods, frameworks, settings, and research samples used to assess Duolingo’s design and impact on various learning outcomes. We carried out a complete database search for articles focused on the issues of design, application, and pedagogies in the use of Duolingo. Three hundred and sixty-seven records were initially found, and 35 of those were selected for final inclusion based on language choice, theoretical frameworks, design, sampling, data collection, and analyses (see Appendix 1 for full list). The results indicated that the majority of research from 2012-2020 was design-focused, quantitative in nature, and used non-probability sampling methods. The focus on app design marks an emphasis on the creation of tools rather than the process and outcomes of language learning from using these tools. Additional results revealed preferences for performance-based research questions, for English as language of choice in research, and for the USA as the most prominent context for Duolingo research studies. Furthermore, our review highlights research gaps specific to Duolingo, yet generalizable to other MALL applications.

It is important for educators from all fields of study, especially English language teachers, to understand the generational differences and the learning preferences of students in order to create productive learning environments. In today’s technology driven era, students have different learning needs in comparison with their predecessors. To enhance language learning in the new generation, it is recommended to use mobile technology in class. Mobile devices and applications offer a wide range of activities that support language learning. The aim of this study was to discover if the students using mobile devices in the class got higher scores in tests than the students using traditional methods. The methods included pre- and post-tests, as well as a questionnaire survey. The results of this study reveal that the use of a mobile application had a positive effect on students’ achievement results as far as the vocabulary learning was concerned. The students using the app seemed to retain more words than the students in the control group. Furthermore, the results of the questionnaire showed that using the app was more enjoyable for students than the traditional teaching methods. In addition, it contributed to collaborative learning. However, the results also indicate that being a Generation Z student does not make him/her automatically interested in using mobile applications in the process of language acquisition.

Mobile assisted language learning (MALL) emerges from this trend and draws traction from relevant stakeholders. While much research has been done on the application of mobile technologies in promoting language learning, and the educational practices that foster that learning approach, relatively little empirical evidence has been given to understand the acceptance and use of MALL by higher education learners, particularly in the context of a developing country. This study sought to fill this gap by applying the modified version of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). Survey data from 293 higher education learners from Vietnam were analyzed by the Rasch-based path model. Results indicated the important roles of attitude and performance expectancy in predicting learners' behavior intention and their usage of MALL. Facilitating condition was found to have no direct effect on learners' usage of MALL, representing a departure from the literature.

Whilst a large amount of research has investigated the implementation of mobile technologies in education, there is still a paucity of research from a teaching perspective across disciplines within higher education. For this reason, this study investigated the acceptance, preparedness and adoption of mobile technologies by academic faculties within higher education, using the context of China. Underpinned by the extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) Model, a large-scale quantitative survey investigated the factors affecting academics’ behavioural intentions and use for mobile technologies, and variations between different demographic groups. Findings suggested that the most significant factors affecting academics’ behavioural intention and behaviours of use were their performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation and habit.

On the other hand, mobile learning has been widely adopted in education in the past decades, and a great deal of previous research has revealed the effects of mobile learning on students' learning. However, few studies have probed teachers' conceptions of mobile technology-integrated instruction. In this study, a total of 25 elementary school teachers in Taiwan were interviewed, and the phenomenographic method was adopted to explore the teachers' conceptions of mobile learning. As a result of the data analysis, seven qualitatively and hierarchically different categories (7-T) of mobile learning were revealed, namely a “Tool,” “Travel,” “Timeliness/Tutor,” a “Toy,” “Tracking,” “Teamwork,” and a “Tutee.” These hierarchical categories represent a spectrum ranging from “teacher-centered” to “student/teacher interaction,” and “student-centered” instructional strategies. Among the 7 categories, 4 (i.e., Toy, Tracking, Teamwork, and Tutee) are considered as student-centered instructional strategies, and the tracking category had the maximum frequency of teachers’ main conceptions of mobile learning. Thus, mobile technology offers opportunities to facilitate student-centered learning. The results provide educators and teachers with deep comprehension of advanced technology-enhanced learning for designing student-centered learning activities.",2021-09-01,2023-07-28 12:55:55,2023-07-28 12:55:55,2023-07-28 12:55:55,104224,,,170,,Computers & Education,In-service teachers' conceptions of mobile technology-integrated instruction,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,C:\Users\iftek\Zotero\storage\YAMFUSXE\S0360131521001019.html,,,Mobile learning; Pedagogical issues; Teacher professional development,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several review studies on MALL have been published to date. However, scholars have not covered certain aspects of familiar contexts in their reviews, such as which learning/instructional methodologies support learning in familiar contexts or what the affordances of familiar contexts are for language learning. To address this gap, the authors in this study reviewed research articles related to MALL in familiar, authentic environments published in the past 10 years. The reviewed articles were from journals published in the Social Science Citation Index between 2009 and 2018. The main aim of this study was to review the published articles to understand (1) pedagogical approaches, (2) data collection, (3) locations, (4) affordances of authentic environments and (5) issues in MALL research. The results revealed that the most frequent items in reviewed articles were task-based learning and communicative language teaching (pedagogical approaches); questionnaires, pretest and posttests and interviews (data collection); the local community and campus (locations); daily encounters, language learning and cognitive load (affordances of authentic environments); and small sample sizes and short-term interventions (issues in MALL research). Based on the results, the authors in this study made several suggestions and provided implications for educators and researchers in the field about MALL in familiar, authentic environments.",2020,2023-07-28 12:56:15,2023-07-28 12:56:15,2023-07-28 12:56:15,709-720,,3,51,,,,,,,,,,en,© 2019 British Educational Research Association,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/bjet.12839,,,,,MALL; authentic; familiar; review,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the review of mobile learning in ESP is scarce, despite its importance in sustaining education. Thus, this review systematically identifies the trends of mobile learning concerning ESP. Using three databases, namely Web of Science (WoS), Scopus, and Educational Resources Information Centre (ERIC), 28 articles were extracted out of 139, from 2012 to 2021, with exclusion and inclusion criteria taken into consideration. First, the significant findings portrayed that mobile apps are the most commonly used means of mobile learning. Second, vocabulary and language competency is more emphasised in mobile learning for ESP. Third, mobile learning in ESP mostly dominated the business field of studies. These three findings implied that there are still gaps in research on mobile learning and ESP. Generally, this review is valuable for practitioners to know which mobile learning tool is ready to be used and in identifying gaps for research in mobile learning and ESP, to sustain education for the future.",2021-01,2023-07-28 13:05:58,2023-07-28 13:05:58,2023-07-28 13:05:58,9768,,17,13,,,Sustaining Education with Mobile Learning for English for Specific Purposes (ESP),,,,,,,en,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/,,,,www.mdpi.com,,Number: 17 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,,C:\Users\iftek\Zotero\storage\HKEE5KJN\Rafiq et al. - 2021 - Sustaining Education with Mobile Learning for Engl.pdf,,,mobile learning; educational scenarios; English for Specific Purposes (ESP); English Language Teaching (ELT); sustainable education; vocabulary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study also sought to determine whether gender, grade level and GPA variables would predict their perceptions of MALL. A total of 201 participants enrolled in an EFL teacher education department at a major state university participated in the study and completed the ""Mobile Learning Perception Scale."" Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics (means and frequencies, and percentage) and inferential statistics (MANOVA and regression analysis). Findings revealed that overall the participants had high levels of perceptions about MALL, and that gender, grade level and GPA differences moderated the effects of the measured constructs on their perceptions of MALL. All the interviewees expressed their positive attitudes towards using mobile devices in language instruction. The results of multivariate tests indicated a significant main effect for their gender and their perceptions, as well as an interaction effect between gender and GPA.

The first group had classroom lessons in English about zoo animals and their characteristics. The second group took classroom lessons and worked with a mobile application on location in a public zoo. The third group received the same treatment as the second but, as an extension, was allowed to take the mobile application home for a fortnight. A pre- and a posttest were conducted to measure the individual change in mastery of a set of targeted English words. The results showed that the group which took the mobile phone home improved the most. However, when the additional learning time, spent apart from school, of this third group was controlled for, the superior performance of the group disappeared. The results indicate that students are motivated to use the application in their spare time and that this benefits their learning.
